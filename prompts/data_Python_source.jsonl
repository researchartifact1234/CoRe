Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import queue\n2   import copy\n3   def makeList(splist,n):\n4       for i in range(n):\n5           springs=[]\n6           springs.append(splist[i*2:i*2+2])\n7           springs.append(i)\n8           yield springs\n9   def isSafe(wfs,safe):\n10      while not wfs.empty():\n11          flog=wfs.get()\n12          flogArea=[]\n13          spn=flog[1]+1\n14          for i in range(-1,2):\n15              for j in [-2,2]:\n16                  dx=flog[0][0]+j\n17                  dy=flog[0][1]+i\n18                  if dx>=0 and dx<10 and dy>=0 and dy<10:\n19                      flogArea.append([[dx,dy],spn])\n20          for j in range(-1,2):\n21              for i in [-2,2]:\n22                  dx=flog[0][0]+j\n23                  dy=flog[0][1]+i\n24                  if dx>=0 and dx<10 and dy>=0 and dy<10:\n25                      flogArea.append([[dx,dy],spn])\n26          for i in range(len(safe[spn])):\n27              if safe[spn][i] in flogArea:\n28                  if spn==9:\n29                      return True\n30                  if spn<9:\n31                      wfs.put(safe[spn][i])\n32      return False\n33  while True:\n34      fx,fy=map(int,input().split())\n35      if fx==0 and fy==0:\n36          break\n37      n=int(input())\n38      splist=list(map(int,input().split()))\n39      safe=[]\n40      k=makeList(splist,n)\n41      for spring in k:\n42          temp=[]\n43          for i in range(-1,2):\n44              for j in range(-1,2):\n45                  dw=spring[0][0]+i\n46                  dh=spring[0][1]+j\n47                  if dw>=0 and dw<10 and dh>=0 and dh<10:\n48                      temp.append([[dw,dh],spring[1]])\n49          safe.append(temp)\n50      wfs=queue.Queue()\n51      first=[[fx,fy],-1]\n52      wfs.put(first)\n53      if isSafe(wfs,safe):\n54          print(\"OK\")\n55      else:\n56          print(\"NA\")\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(dy,17)` in function `isSafe`?

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from io import StringIO\n2   from collections import deque\n3   import sys\n4   def main(inputs):\n5       h, w = map(int, next(inputs).split())\n6       mass = [ next(inputs) for _ in range(h) ]\n7       ans = [[-1 for _ in m] for m in mass]\n8       for i in range(h):\n9           for j in range(w):\n10              if ans[i][j] == -1:\n11                  find_black(mass, ans, i, j)\n12                  pass\n13              pass\n14          pass\n15      print(max(sum(ans, [])))\n16      pass\n17  def find_black(mass, ans, h, w):\n18      done = [[False for _ in m] for m in mass]\n19      q = deque()\n20      q.append((h, w, []))\n21      candidate = (-1, 0, [])\n22      candidate_ans = lambda: ans[candidate[0]][candidate[1]] + len(candidate[2])\n23      candidate_exists = lambda: (candidate[0] != -1)\n24      while q:\n25          h, w, path = q.popleft()\n26          if candidate[0] != -1 and ans[candidate[0]][candidate[1]] + len(candidate[2]) <= len(path):\n27              h, w, path = candidate\n28              for idx, (i, j) in enumerate(reversed(path)):\n29                  ans[i][j] = ans[h][w] + idx + 1\n30                  pass\n31              return\n32          if mass[h][w] == '#':\n33              ans[h][w] = 0\n34              pass\n35          if ans[h][w] != -1:\n36              s0 = ans[h][w] + len(path)\n37              s1 = ans[candidate[0]][candidate[1]] + len(candidate[2])\n38              if (candidate[0] == -1) or s0 < s1:\n39                  candidate = (h, w, path[:])\n40                  pass\n41              done[h][w] = True\n42              continue\n43          done[h][w] = True\n44          path.append((h, w))\n45          if h-1 >= 0 and not done[h-1][w]:\n46              q.append((h-1, w, path[:]))\n47              pass\n48          if h+1 < len(mass) and not done[h+1][w]:\n49              q.append((h+1, w, path[:]))\n50              pass\n51          if w-1 >= 0 and not done[h][w-1]:\n52              q.append((h, w-1, path[:]))\n53              pass\n54          if w+1 < len(mass[0]) and not done[h][w+1]:\n55              q.append((h, w+1, path[:]))\n56              pass\n57          pass\n58      pass\n59  def gen_inputs(str_=None):\n60      inputs = StringIO(str_) if str_ else sys.stdin\n61      while True:\n62          a = inputs.readline().rstrip()\n63          yield a\n64          pass\n65      pass\n66  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n67      main(gen_inputs())\n68      pass\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(s0,36)` in function `find_black`?

In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from sys import stdout\n2   from bisect import bisect_left as binl\n3   from copy import copy, deepcopy\n4   mod = 1\n5   def intin():\n6       input_tuple = input().split()\n7       if len(input_tuple) <= 1:\n8           return int(input_tuple[0])\n9       return tuple(map(int, input_tuple))\n10  def intina():\n11      return [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n12  def intinl(count):\n13      return [intin() for _ in range(count)]\n14  def modadd(x, y):\n15      global mod\n16      return (x + y) % mod\n17  def modmlt(x, y):\n18      global mod\n19      return (x * y) % mod\n20  def lcm(x, y):\n21      while y != 0:\n22          z = x % y\n23          x = y\n24          y = z\n25      return x\n26  def combination(x, y):\n27      assert(x >= y)\n28      if y > x // 2:\n29          y = x - y\n30      ret = 1\n31      for i in range(0, y):\n32          j = x - i\n33          i = i + 1\n34          ret = ret * j\n35          ret = ret // i\n36      return ret\n37  def get_divisors(x):\n38      retlist = []\n39      for i in range(1, int(x**0.5) + 3):\n40          if x % i == 0:\n41              retlist.append(i)\n42              retlist.append(x // i)\n43      return retlist\n44  def get_factors(x):\n45      retlist = []\n46      for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 3):\n47          while x % i == 0:\n48              retlist.append(i)\n49              x = x // i\n50      retlist.append(x)\n51      return retlist\n52  def make_linklist(xylist):\n53      linklist = {}\n54      for a, b in xylist:\n55          linklist.setdefault(a, [])\n56          linklist.setdefault(b, [])\n57          linklist[a].append(b)\n58          linklist[b].append(a)\n59      return linklist\n60  def calc_longest_distance(linklist, v=1):\n61      distance_list = {}\n62      distance_count = 0\n63      distance = 0\n64      vlist_previous = []\n65      vlist = [v]\n66      nodecount = len(linklist)\n67      while distance_count < nodecount:\n68          vlist_next = []\n69          for v in vlist:\n70              distance_list[v] = distance\n71              distance_count += 1\n72              vlist_next.extend(linklist[v])\n73          distance += 1\n74          vlist_to_del = vlist_previous\n75          vlist_previous = vlist\n76          vlist = list(set(vlist_next) - set(vlist_to_del))\n77      max_distance = -1\n78      max_v = None\n79      for v, distance in distance_list.items():\n80          if distance > max_distance:\n81              max_distance = distance\n82              max_v = v\n83      return (max_distance, max_v)\n84  def calc_tree_diameter(linklist, v=1):\n85      _, u = calc_longest_distance(linklist, v)\n86      distance, _ = calc_longest_distance(linklist, u)\n87      return distance\n88  def main():\n89      a, b = intin()\n90      if a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:\n91          print('Yes')\n92      else:\n93          print('No')\n94  if __name__ == '__main__':\n95      main()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(nodecount,66)` in function `calc_longest_distance`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`?

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import math,string,itertools,fractions,heapq,collections,re,array,bisect,sys,copy,functools\n2   import random\n3   sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)\n4   inf = 10**20\n5   eps = 1.0 / 10**10\n6   mod = 10**9+7\n7   dd = [(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]\n8   ddn = [(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1)]\n9   def LI(): return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n10  def LLI(): return [list(map(int, l.split())) for l in sys.stdin.readlines()]\n11  def LI_(): return [int(x)-1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n12  def LF(): return [float(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n13  def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()\n14  def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\n15  def F(): return float(sys.stdin.readline())\n16  def S(): return input()\n17  def pf(s): return print(s, flush=True)\n18  def pe(s): return print(str(s), file=sys.stderr)\n19  def main():\n20      q = I()\n21      aa = [LI() for _ in range(q)]\n22      bt = aa[0][2]\n23      m = 2 ** 20\n24      c = collections.defaultdict(int)\n25      lq = [inf]\n26      rq = [inf]\n27      c[-inf] = 1\n28      c[inf] = 1\n29      x = aa[0][1]\n30      c[x] = 1\n31      xl = 0\n32      lc = 0\n33      xr = 0\n34      rc = 0\n35      r = []\n36      for t in aa[1:]:\n37          if t[0] == 2:\n38              r.append('{} {}'.format(x, xl+xr+bt))\n39          else:\n40              _,a,b = t\n41              bt += b\n42              if a == x:\n43                  c[x] += 1\n44                  continue\n45              c[a] += 1\n46              if c[a] == 1:\n47                  if a < x:\n48                      heapq.heappush(lq,-a)\n49                  else:\n50                      heapq.heappush(rq,a)\n51              xc = c[x]\n52              if a < x:\n53                  xl += x - a\n54                  lc += 1\n55                  t = xl + xr\n56                  nx = -lq[0]\n57                  nc = c[nx]\n58                  s = x - nx\n59                  nt = xl - lc * s + xr + (rc+xc) * s\n60                  if nt <= t:\n61                      xl -= lc * s\n62                      xr += (rc+xc) * s\n63                      lc -= nc\n64                      rc += xc\n65                      heapq.heappush(rq,x)\n66                      x = nx\n67                      heapq.heappop(lq)\n68              else:\n69                  xr += a - x\n70                  rc += 1\n71                  t = xl + xr\n72                  nx = rq[0]\n73                  nc = c[nx]\n74                  s = nx - x\n75                  nt = xl + (lc+xc) * s + xr - rc * s\n76                  if nt < t:\n77                      xl += (lc+xc) * s\n78                      xr -= rc * s\n79                      lc += xc\n80                      rc -= nc\n81                      heapq.heappush(lq,-x)\n82                      x = nx\n83                      heapq.heappop(rq)\n84      return '\\n'.join(r)\n85  print(main())\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(t,55)` in function `main`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself).

In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys\n2   def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n3   def Z(): return int(input())\n4   def ZZ(): return [int(_) for _ in input().split()]\n5   def main():\n6       N = Z()\n7       A = []\n8       for _ in range(N):\n9           A.append(Z())\n10      A = sorted(A)\n11      used = [0] * (N)\n12      output1 = output2 = 0\n13      i1 = i2 = 0\n14      j1, j2 = N-1, N-2\n15      f1 = f2 = True\n16      used[i1], used[i2], used[j1], used[j2] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n17      while f1 or f2:\n18          if f1: output1 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n19          if f2: output1 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n20          while used[i1]:\n21              if i1 == N-1:\n22                  f1 = False\n23                  break\n24              i1 += 1\n25          used[i1] = 1\n26          while used[i2]:\n27              if i2 == N-1:\n28                  f2 = False\n29                  break\n30              i2 += 1\n31          used[i2] = 1\n32          if f1: \n33              output1 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n34          if f2: \n35              output1 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n36          while used[j1]:\n37              if j1 == 0:\n38                  f1 = False\n39                  break\n40              j1 -= 1\n41          used[j1] = 1\n42          while used[j2]:\n43              if j2 == 0:\n44                  f2 = False\n45                  break\n46              j2 -= 1\n47          used[j2] = 1\n48      i1, i2 = 0, 1\n49      j1 = j2 = N-1\n50      f1 = f2 = True\n51      used = [0] * (N)\n52      used[i1], used[i2], used[j1], used[j2] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n53      while f1 or f2:\n54          if f1: \n55              output2 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n56          if f2: \n57              output2 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n58          while used[j1]:\n59              if j1 == 0:\n60                  f1 = False\n61                  break\n62              j1 -= 1\n63          used[j1] = 1\n64          while used[j2]:\n65              if j2 == 0:\n66                  f2 = False\n67                  break\n68              j2 -= 1\n69          used[j2] = 1\n70          if f1: \n71              output2 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n72          if f2: \n73              output2 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n74          while used[i1]:\n75              if i1 == N-1:\n76                  f1 = False\n77                  break\n78              i1 += 1\n79          used[i1] = 1\n80          while used[i2]:\n81              if i2 == N-1:\n82                  f2 = False\n83                  break\n84              i2 += 1\n85          used[i2] = 1\n86      print(max(output1, output2))\n87      return\n88  if __name__ == '__main__':\n89      main()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(used,63)` in function `main`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys\n2   def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n3   def Z(): return int(input())\n4   def ZZ(): return [int(_) for _ in input().split()]\n5   def main():\n6       N = Z()\n7       A = []\n8       for _ in range(N):\n9           A.append(Z())\n10      A = sorted(A)\n11      used = [0] * (N)\n12      output1 = output2 = 0\n13      i1 = i2 = 0\n14      j1, j2 = N-1, N-2\n15      f1 = f2 = True\n16      used[i1], used[i2], used[j1], used[j2] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n17      while f1 or f2:\n18          if f1: output1 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n19          if f2: output1 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n20          while used[i1]:\n21              if i1 == N-1:\n22                  f1 = False\n23                  break\n24              i1 += 1\n25          used[i1] = 1\n26          while used[i2]:\n27              if i2 == N-1:\n28                  f2 = False\n29                  break\n30              i2 += 1\n31          used[i2] = 1\n32          if f1: \n33              output1 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n34          if f2: \n35              output1 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n36          while used[j1]:\n37              if j1 == 0:\n38                  f1 = False\n39                  break\n40              j1 -= 1\n41          used[j1] = 1\n42          while used[j2]:\n43              if j2 == 0:\n44                  f2 = False\n45                  break\n46              j2 -= 1\n47          used[j2] = 1\n48      i1, i2 = 0, 1\n49      j1 = j2 = N-1\n50      f1 = f2 = True\n51      used = [0] * (N)\n52      used[i1], used[i2], used[j1], used[j2] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n53      while f1 or f2:\n54          if f1: \n55              output2 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n56          if f2: \n57              output2 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n58          while used[j1]:\n59              if j1 == 0:\n60                  f1 = False\n61                  break\n62              j1 -= 1\n63          used[j1] = 1\n64          while used[j2]:\n65              if j2 == 0:\n66                  f2 = False\n67                  break\n68              j2 -= 1\n69          used[j2] = 1\n70          if f1: \n71              output2 += (A[j1]-A[i1])\n72          if f2: \n73              output2 += (A[j2]-A[i2])\n74          while used[i1]:\n75              if i1 == N-1:\n76                  f1 = False\n77                  break\n78              i1 += 1\n79          used[i1] = 1\n80          while used[i2]:\n81              if i2 == N-1:\n82                  f2 = False\n83                  break\n84              i2 += 1\n85          used[i2] = 1\n86      print(max(output1, output2))\n87      return\n88  if __name__ == '__main__':\n89      main()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(used,85)` in function `main`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys,

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys,

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys,

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys,

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys,

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import sys\n2   import bisect\n3   def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n4   def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\n5   def solve():\n6       n = I()\n7       p = [LI() for i in range(n)]\n8       p.sort()\n9       m = 1<<n\n10      s = 0\n11      for i,(x,y,num) in enumerate(p):\n12          d = min(abs(x),abs(y))\n13          s += num*d\n14      ans = [s]*(n+1)\n15      ans[-1] = 0\n16      pow = [1<<i for i in range(n)]\n17      dx = [[None]*m for i in range(n)]\n18      dy = [[None]*m for i in range(n)]\n19      for b in range(m):\n20          lx = []\n21          ly = []\n22          res = b\n23          for x,y,_ in p:\n24              j = res&1\n25              if j:\n26                  lx.append(x)\n27                  ly.append(y)\n28              res >>= 1\n29          ly.sort()\n30          for j,(x,y,num) in enumerate(p):\n31              i = bisect.bisect_left(lx,x)-1\n32              dxj = abs(x)\n33              dyj = abs(y)\n34              if i >= 0:\n35                  nd = x-lx[i]\n36                  if nd < dxj:\n37                      dxj = nd\n38              i += 1\n39              if i < len(lx):\n40                  nd = lx[i]-x\n41                  if nd < dxj:\n42                      dxj = nd\n43              i += 1\n44              if i < len(lx):\n45                  nd = lx[i]-x\n46                  if nd < dxj:\n47                      dxj = nd\n48              i = bisect.bisect_left(ly,y)-1\n49              if i >= 0:\n50                  nd = y-ly[i]\n51                  if nd < dyj:\n52                      dyj = nd\n53              i += 1\n54              if i < len(ly):\n55                  nd = ly[i]-y\n56                  if nd < dyj:\n57                      dyj = nd\n58              i += 1\n59              if i < len(ly):\n60                  nd = ly[i]-y\n61                  if nd < dyj:\n62                      dyj = nd\n63              dx[j][b] = dxj*num\n64              dy[j][b] = dyj*num\n65      m = 3**n\n66      for b in range(m):\n67          kx = ky = cnt = 0\n68          res = b\n69          for i in range(n):\n70              j = res%3\n71              if j:\n72                  cnt += 1\n73                  if j == 1:\n74                      kx |= pow[i]\n75                  else:\n76                      ky |= pow[i]\n77              res //= 3\n78          s = 0\n79          ans_ = ans[cnt]\n80          for i in range(n):\n81              d = min(dx[i][kx],dy[i][ky])\n82              s += d\n83              if s >= ans_:\n84                  break\n85          else:\n86              ans[cnt] = s\n87      for i in ans:\n88          print(i)\n89      return\n90  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n91      solve()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(res,77)` in function `solve`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import math,string,itertools,fractions,heapq,collections,re,array,bisect,sys,random,time,copy,functools\n2   sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)\n3   def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n4   def LI_(): return [int(x)-1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n5   def LF(): return [float(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n6   def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()\n7   def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\n8   def F(): return float(sys.stdin.readline())\n9   def S(): return input()\n10  def pf(s): return print(s, flush=True)\n11  def main():\n12      inf = 10**20\n13      eps = 1.0 / 10**10\n14      mod = 10**9+7\n15      ddn = [(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1)]\n16      dd = [(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]\n17      rr = []\n18      while True:\n19          n = I()\n20          if n == 0:\n21              break\n22          a = []\n23          for _ in range(n):\n24              a.append(LS())\n25          d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n26          ed = collections.defaultdict(lambda: None)\n27          for i in range(n):\n28              x, y, di = a[i]\n29              x = int(x)\n30              y = int(y)\n31              d[(x,y)] = i + 1\n32              if di == 'x':\n33                  d[(x+1,y)] = i + 1\n34                  ed[(x,y)] = (x+1,y)\n35                  ed[(x+1,y)] = (x,y)\n36              else:\n37                  d[(x,y+1)] = i + 1\n38                  ed[(x,y)] = (x,y+1)\n39                  ed[(x,y+1)] = (x,y)\n40          ee = collections.defaultdict(set)\n41          dka = list(d.keys())\n42          for x,y in list(d.keys()):\n43              dt = d[(x,y)]\n44              for di,dj in dd:\n45                  ni = x + di\n46                  nj = y + dj\n47                  if d[(ni,nj)] > 0 and d[(ni,nj)] != dt:\n48                      ee[(x,y)].add((ni,nj))\n49          v = collections.defaultdict(bool)\n50          f = True\n51          for k in dka:\n52              if v[k]:\n53                  continue\n54              s1 = set()\n55              s2 = set()\n56              ns1 = set([k])\n57              ns2 = set()\n58              while ns1 or ns2:\n59                  s1 |= ns1\n60                  na = list(ns1)\n61                  ns1 = set()\n62                  for k in na:\n63                      ns1 |= ee[k]\n64                      ns2.add(ed[k])\n65                  ns2 -= s2\n66                  na = list(ns2)\n67                  s2 |= ns2\n68                  ns2 = set()\n69                  for k in na:\n70                      ns2 |= ee[k]\n71                      ns1.add(ed[k])\n72                  ns1 -= s1\n73                  ns2 -= s2\n74                  s1 |= ns1\n75                  s2 |= ns2\n76                  if s1 & s2:\n77                      f = False\n78                      break\n79              if f:\n80                  for k in s1:\n81                      v[k] = 1\n82                  for k in s2:\n83                      v[k] = 1\n84              else:\n85                  break\n86          if f:\n87              rr.append('Yes')\n88          else:\n89              rr.append('No')\n90      return '\\n'.join(map(str,rr))\n91  print(main())\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(di,28)` in function `main`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`?

List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   import math,string,itertools,fractions,heapq,collections,re,array,bisect,sys,random,time,copy,functools\n2   sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)\n3   def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n4   def LI_(): return [int(x)-1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n5   def LF(): return [float(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n6   def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()\n7   def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\n8   def F(): return float(sys.stdin.readline())\n9   def S(): return input()\n10  def pf(s): return print(s, flush=True)\n11  def main():\n12      inf = 10**20\n13      eps = 1.0 / 10**10\n14      mod = 10**9+7\n15      ddn = [(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1)]\n16      dd = [(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]\n17      rr = []\n18      while True:\n19          n = I()\n20          if n == 0:\n21              break\n22          a = []\n23          for _ in range(n):\n24              a.append(LS())\n25          d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n26          ed = collections.defaultdict(lambda: None)\n27          for i in range(n):\n28              x, y, di = a[i]\n29              x = int(x)\n30              y = int(y)\n31              d[(x,y)] = i + 1\n32              if di == 'x':\n33                  d[(x+1,y)] = i + 1\n34                  ed[(x,y)] = (x+1,y)\n35                  ed[(x+1,y)] = (x,y)\n36              else:\n37                  d[(x,y+1)] = i + 1\n38                  ed[(x,y)] = (x,y+1)\n39                  ed[(x,y+1)] = (x,y)\n40          ee = collections.defaultdict(set)\n41          dka = list(d.keys())\n42          for x,y in list(d.keys()):\n43              dt = d[(x,y)]\n44              for di,dj in dd:\n45                  ni = x + di\n46                  nj = y + dj\n47                  if d[(ni,nj)] > 0 and d[(ni,nj)] != dt:\n48                      ee[(x,y)].add((ni,nj))\n49          v = collections.defaultdict(bool)\n50          f = True\n51          for k in dka:\n52              if v[k]:\n53                  continue\n54              s1 = set()\n55              s2 = set()\n56              ns1 = set([k])\n57              ns2 = set()\n58              while ns1 or ns2:\n59                  s1 |= ns1\n60                  na = list(ns1)\n61                  ns1 = set()\n62                  for k in na:\n63                      ns1 |= ee[k]\n64                      ns2.add(ed[k])\n65                  ns2 -= s2\n66                  na = list(ns2)\n67                  s2 |= ns2\n68                  ns2 = set()\n69                  for k in na:\n70                      ns2 |= ee[k]\n71                      ns1.add(ed[k])\n72                  ns1 -= s1\n73                  ns2 -= s2\n74                  s1 |= ns1\n75                  s2 |= ns2\n76                  if s1 & s2:\n77                      f = False\n78                      break\n79              if f:\n80                  for k in s1:\n81                      v[k] = 1\n82                  for k in s2:\n83                      v[k] = 1\n84              else:\n85                  break\n86          if f:\n87              rr.append('Yes')\n88          else:\n89              rr.append('No')\n90      return '\\n'.join(map(str,rr))\n91  print(main())\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(v,83)` in function `main`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from collections import defaultdict, deque\n2   from heapq import heappush, heappop\n3   from itertools import permutations, accumulate\n4   import sys\n5   import math\n6   import bisect\n7   def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()]\n8   def I(): return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())\n9   def LS():return [list(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n10  def S():\n11      res = list(sys.stdin.readline())\n12      if res[-1] == \"\\n\":\n13          return res[:-1]\n14      return res\n15  def IR(n):\n16      return [I() for i in range(n)]\n17  def LIR(n):\n18      return [LI() for i in range(n)]\n19  def SR(n):\n20      return [S() for i in range(n)]\n21  def LSR(n):\n22      return [LS() for i in range(n)]\n23  sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n24  def solve():\n25      mod = 1000000007\n26      s = S()\n27      t = S()\n28      ns = len(s)\n29      nt = len(t)\n30      f = {}\n31      for i in range(26):\n32          f[chr(i + ord(\"a\"))] = i + 1\n33      for i in range(ns):\n34          s[i] = f[s[i]]\n35      for i in range(nt):\n36          t[i] = f[t[i]]\n37      b = 10\n38      mod1 = 1000000007\n39      mod2 = 1000000009\n40      pownt1 = pow(b,nt,mod)\n41      invnt1 = pow(pownt1,mod1-2,mod1)\n42      powns1 = pow(b,ns,mod1)\n43      invns1 = pow(powns1,mod1-2,mod1)\n44      pownt2 = pow(b,nt,mod2)\n45      invnt2 = pow(pownt2,mod2-2,mod2)\n46      powns2 = pow(b,ns,mod2)\n47      invns2 = pow(powns2,mod2-2,mod2)\n48      l = 0\n49      r = ns+2\n50      while r > l+1:\n51          m = (l+r) >> 1\n52          n = m*nt\n53          st = [m]*nt\n54          ms = n//ns\n55          rs = n-ms*ns\n56          ss = []\n57          for i in range(ns):\n58              if i < rs:\n59                  ss.append(ms + 1)\n60              else:\n61                  ss.append(ms)\n62          p1 = pow(b,n,mod1)\n63          p2 = pow(b,n,mod2)\n64          h1 = 0\n65          h2 = 0\n66          for i in range(nt):\n67              ti = t[i]\n68              pow1 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod1,mod1)\n69              pows1 = pow(pownt1,st[i],mod1)\n70              h1 += ti*pow1*(pows1-1)*pow(pows1*(1-invnt1),mod1-2,mod1)%mod1\n71              h1 %= mod1\n72              pow2 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod2,mod2)\n73              pows2 = pow(pownt2,st[i],mod2)\n74              h2 += ti*pow2*(pows2-1)*pow(pows2*(1-invnt2),mod2-2,mod2)%mod2\n75              h2 %= mod2\n76          k1 = 0\n77          k2 = 0\n78          for i in range(ns):\n79              if not ss[i]:\n80                  break\n81              si = s[i]\n82              pow1 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod1,mod1)\n83              pows1 = pow(powns1,ss[i],mod1)\n84              k1 += si*pow1*(pows1-1)*pow(pows1*(1-invns1),mod1-2,mod1)%mod1\n85              k1 %= mod1\n86              pow2 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod2,mod2)\n87              pows2 = pow(powns2,ss[i],mod2)\n88              k2 += si*pow2*(pows2-1)*pow(pows2*(1-invns2),mod2-2,mod2)%mod2\n89              k2 %= mod2\n90          k = 0\n91          for j in range(rs,ns+rs):\n92              if (h1,h2) == (k1,k2):\n93                  l = m\n94                  break\n95              i = j%ns\n96              si = s[i]\n97              sk = s[k]\n98              k1 -= sk*p1%mod1\n99              k1 += si\n100              k1 *= b\n101              k1 %= mod1\n102              k2 -= sk*p2%mod2\n103              k2 += si\n104              k2 *= b\n105              k2 %= mod2\n106              k += 1\n107          else:\n108              r = m\n109      if l == ns+1:\n110          print(-1)\n111      else:\n112          print(l)\n113      return\n114  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n115      solve()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(pow2,72)` in function `solve`?

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from collections import defaultdict, deque\n2   from heapq import heappush, heappop\n3   from itertools import permutations, accumulate\n4   import sys\n5   import math\n6   import bisect\n7   def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()]\n8   def I(): return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())\n9   def LS():return [list(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n10  def S():\n11      res = list(sys.stdin.readline())\n12      if res[-1] == \"\\n\":\n13          return res[:-1]\n14      return res\n15  def IR(n):\n16      return [I() for i in range(n)]\n17  def LIR(n):\n18      return [LI() for i in range(n)]\n19  def SR(n):\n20      return [S() for i in range(n)]\n21  def LSR(n):\n22      return [LS() for i in range(n)]\n23  sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\n24  def solve():\n25      mod = 1000000007\n26      s = S()\n27      t = S()\n28      ns = len(s)\n29      nt = len(t)\n30      f = {}\n31      for i in range(26):\n32          f[chr(i + ord(\"a\"))] = i + 1\n33      for i in range(ns):\n34          s[i] = f[s[i]]\n35      for i in range(nt):\n36          t[i] = f[t[i]]\n37      b = 10\n38      mod1 = 1000000007\n39      mod2 = 1000000009\n40      pownt1 = pow(b,nt,mod)\n41      invnt1 = pow(pownt1,mod1-2,mod1)\n42      powns1 = pow(b,ns,mod1)\n43      invns1 = pow(powns1,mod1-2,mod1)\n44      pownt2 = pow(b,nt,mod2)\n45      invnt2 = pow(pownt2,mod2-2,mod2)\n46      powns2 = pow(b,ns,mod2)\n47      invns2 = pow(powns2,mod2-2,mod2)\n48      l = 0\n49      r = ns+2\n50      while r > l+1:\n51          m = (l+r) >> 1\n52          n = m*nt\n53          st = [m]*nt\n54          ms = n//ns\n55          rs = n-ms*ns\n56          ss = []\n57          for i in range(ns):\n58              if i < rs:\n59                  ss.append(ms + 1)\n60              else:\n61                  ss.append(ms)\n62          p1 = pow(b,n,mod1)\n63          p2 = pow(b,n,mod2)\n64          h1 = 0\n65          h2 = 0\n66          for i in range(nt):\n67              ti = t[i]\n68              pow1 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod1,mod1)\n69              pows1 = pow(pownt1,st[i],mod1)\n70              h1 += ti*pow1*(pows1-1)*pow(pows1*(1-invnt1),mod1-2,mod1)%mod1\n71              h1 %= mod1\n72              pow2 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod2,mod2)\n73              pows2 = pow(pownt2,st[i],mod2)\n74              h2 += ti*pow2*(pows2-1)*pow(pows2*(1-invnt2),mod2-2,mod2)%mod2\n75              h2 %= mod2\n76          k1 = 0\n77          k2 = 0\n78          for i in range(ns):\n79              if not ss[i]:\n80                  break\n81              si = s[i]\n82              pow1 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod1,mod1)\n83              pows1 = pow(powns1,ss[i],mod1)\n84              k1 += si*pow1*(pows1-1)*pow(pows1*(1-invns1),mod1-2,mod1)%mod1\n85              k1 %= mod1\n86              pow2 = pow(b,(n-i)*mod2,mod2)\n87              pows2 = pow(powns2,ss[i],mod2)\n88              k2 += si*pow2*(pows2-1)*pow(pows2*(1-invns2),mod2-2,mod2)%mod2\n89              k2 %= mod2\n90          k = 0\n91          for j in range(rs,ns+rs):\n92              if (h1,h2) == (k1,k2):\n93                  l = m\n94                  break\n95              i = j%ns\n96              si = s[i]\n97              sk = s[k]\n98              k1 -= sk*p1%mod1\n99              k1 += si\n100              k1 *= b\n101              k1 %= mod1\n102              k2 -= sk*p2%mod2\n103              k2 += si\n104              k2 *= b\n105              k2 %= mod2\n106              k += 1\n107          else:\n108              r = m\n109      if l == ns+1:\n110          print(-1)\n111      else:\n112          print(l)\n113      return\n114  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n115      solve()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(rs,55)` in function `solve`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   def areInConflict(x, y):\n2       bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n3       by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n4       lx = len(bx)\n5       ly = len(by)\n6       for i in range(min(lx, ly)):\n7           if bx[i]==\"1\" and by[i]==\"1\":\n8               return True\n9       return False\n10  def solve(x,y):\n11      origX = x\n12      origY = y\n13      x = max(x, -x)\n14      y = max(y, -y)\n15      if x%2==y%2:\n16          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n17      x1 = 1\n18      while x1 < x:\n19          x1 *= 2\n20      x2 = x1 - x\n21      y1 = 1\n22      while y1 < y:\n23          y1 *= 2\n24      y2 = y1 - y\n25      if not areInConflict(x, y):\n26          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n27          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n28          result = [None] * max(len(bx),len(by))\n29          for i in range(len(bx)):\n30              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n31                  result[i] = \"E\"\n32          for i in range(len(by)):\n33              if by[i] == \"1\":\n34                  result[i] = \"N\"\n35      elif not areInConflict(x2, x1) and not areInConflict(x2, y) and not areInConflict(x1, y):\n36          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n37          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n38          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n39          result = [None] * max(len(bx1), len(bx2), len(by))\n40          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n41              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n42                  result[i] = \"E\"\n43          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n44              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n45                  result[i] = \"W\"\n46          for i in range(len(by)):\n47              if by[i] == \"1\":\n48                  result[i] = \"N\"\n49      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) and not areInConflict(y2, x) and not areInConflict(y1, x):\n50          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n51          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n52          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n53          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n54          for i in range(len(bx)):\n55              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n56                  result[i] = \"E\"\n57          for i in range(len(by1)):\n58              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n59                  result[i] = \"N\"\n60          for i in range(len(by2)):\n61              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n62                  result[i] = \"S\"\n63      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) \\\n64          and not areInConflict(y2, x1) \\\n65          and not areInConflict(y2, x2) \\\n66          and not areInConflict(y1, x1) \\\n67          and not areInConflict(y1, x2) \\\n68          and not areInConflict(x2, x1):\n69          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n70          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n71          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n72          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n73          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n74          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n75              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n76                  result[i] = \"E\"\n77          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n78              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n79                  result[i] = \"W\"\n80          for i in range(len(by1)):\n81              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n82                  result[i] = \"N\"\n83          for i in range(len(by2)):\n84              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n85                  result[i] = \"S\"\n86      else:\n87          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n88      if x != origX:\n89          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n90              if result[i]==\"W\":\n91                  result[i] = \"E\"\n92              elif result[i]==\"E\":\n93                  result[i] = \"W\"\n94      if y != origY:\n95          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n96              if result[i]==\"N\":\n97                  result[i] = \"S\"\n98              elif result[i]==\"S\":\n99                  result[i] = \"N\"\n100      return \"\".join(result)\n101  T = int(raw_input())\n102  for t in range(T):\n103      x,y = map(int,raw_input().split())\n104      print \"Case #{}: {}\".format(t+1, solve(x, y))\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(x,18)` in function `solve`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   def areInConflict(x, y):\n2       bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n3       by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n4       lx = len(bx)\n5       ly = len(by)\n6       for i in range(min(lx, ly)):\n7           if bx[i]==\"1\" and by[i]==\"1\":\n8               return True\n9       return False\n10  def solve(x,y):\n11      origX = x\n12      origY = y\n13      x = max(x, -x)\n14      y = max(y, -y)\n15      if x%2==y%2:\n16          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n17      x1 = 1\n18      while x1 < x:\n19          x1 *= 2\n20      x2 = x1 - x\n21      y1 = 1\n22      while y1 < y:\n23          y1 *= 2\n24      y2 = y1 - y\n25      if not areInConflict(x, y):\n26          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n27          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n28          result = [None] * max(len(bx),len(by))\n29          for i in range(len(bx)):\n30              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n31                  result[i] = \"E\"\n32          for i in range(len(by)):\n33              if by[i] == \"1\":\n34                  result[i] = \"N\"\n35      elif not areInConflict(x2, x1) and not areInConflict(x2, y) and not areInConflict(x1, y):\n36          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n37          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n38          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n39          result = [None] * max(len(bx1), len(bx2), len(by))\n40          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n41              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n42                  result[i] = \"E\"\n43          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n44              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n45                  result[i] = \"W\"\n46          for i in range(len(by)):\n47              if by[i] == \"1\":\n48                  result[i] = \"N\"\n49      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) and not areInConflict(y2, x) and not areInConflict(y1, x):\n50          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n51          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n52          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n53          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n54          for i in range(len(bx)):\n55              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n56                  result[i] = \"E\"\n57          for i in range(len(by1)):\n58              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n59                  result[i] = \"N\"\n60          for i in range(len(by2)):\n61              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n62                  result[i] = \"S\"\n63      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) \\\n64          and not areInConflict(y2, x1) \\\n65          and not areInConflict(y2, x2) \\\n66          and not areInConflict(y1, x1) \\\n67          and not areInConflict(y1, x2) \\\n68          and not areInConflict(x2, x1):\n69          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n70          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n71          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n72          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n73          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n74          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n75              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n76                  result[i] = \"E\"\n77          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n78              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n79                  result[i] = \"W\"\n80          for i in range(len(by1)):\n81              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n82                  result[i] = \"N\"\n83          for i in range(len(by2)):\n84              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n85                  result[i] = \"S\"\n86      else:\n87          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n88      if x != origX:\n89          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n90              if result[i]==\"W\":\n91                  result[i] = \"E\"\n92              elif result[i]==\"E\":\n93                  result[i] = \"W\"\n94      if y != origY:\n95          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n96              if result[i]==\"N\":\n97                  result[i] = \"S\"\n98              elif result[i]==\"S\":\n99                  result[i] = \"N\"\n100      return \"\".join(result)\n101  T = int(raw_input())\n102  for t in range(T):\n103      x,y = map(int,raw_input().split())\n104      print \"Case #{}: {}\".format(t+1, solve(x, y))\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(x1,18)` in function `solve`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   def areInConflict(x, y):\n2       bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n3       by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n4       lx = len(bx)\n5       ly = len(by)\n6       for i in range(min(lx, ly)):\n7           if bx[i]==\"1\" and by[i]==\"1\":\n8               return True\n9       return False\n10  def solve(x,y):\n11      origX = x\n12      origY = y\n13      x = max(x, -x)\n14      y = max(y, -y)\n15      if x%2==y%2:\n16          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n17      x1 = 1\n18      while x1 < x:\n19          x1 *= 2\n20      x2 = x1 - x\n21      y1 = 1\n22      while y1 < y:\n23          y1 *= 2\n24      y2 = y1 - y\n25      if not areInConflict(x, y):\n26          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n27          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n28          result = [None] * max(len(bx),len(by))\n29          for i in range(len(bx)):\n30              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n31                  result[i] = \"E\"\n32          for i in range(len(by)):\n33              if by[i] == \"1\":\n34                  result[i] = \"N\"\n35      elif not areInConflict(x2, x1) and not areInConflict(x2, y) and not areInConflict(x1, y):\n36          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n37          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n38          by = \"{0:b}\".format(y)[::-1]\n39          result = [None] * max(len(bx1), len(bx2), len(by))\n40          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n41              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n42                  result[i] = \"E\"\n43          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n44              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n45                  result[i] = \"W\"\n46          for i in range(len(by)):\n47              if by[i] == \"1\":\n48                  result[i] = \"N\"\n49      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) and not areInConflict(y2, x) and not areInConflict(y1, x):\n50          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n51          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n52          bx = \"{0:b}\".format(x)[::-1]\n53          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n54          for i in range(len(bx)):\n55              if bx[i] == \"1\":\n56                  result[i] = \"E\"\n57          for i in range(len(by1)):\n58              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n59                  result[i] = \"N\"\n60          for i in range(len(by2)):\n61              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n62                  result[i] = \"S\"\n63      elif not areInConflict(y2, y1) \\\n64          and not areInConflict(y2, x1) \\\n65          and not areInConflict(y2, x2) \\\n66          and not areInConflict(y1, x1) \\\n67          and not areInConflict(y1, x2) \\\n68          and not areInConflict(x2, x1):\n69          bx1 = \"{0:b}\".format(x1)[::-1]\n70          bx2 = \"{0:b}\".format(x2)[::-1]\n71          by1 = \"{0:b}\".format(y1)[::-1]\n72          by2 = \"{0:b}\".format(y2)[::-1]\n73          result = [None] * max(len(by1), len(by2), len(bx))\n74          for i in range(len(bx1)):\n75              if bx1[i] == \"1\":\n76                  result[i] = \"E\"\n77          for i in range(len(bx2)):\n78              if bx2[i] == \"1\":\n79                  result[i] = \"W\"\n80          for i in range(len(by1)):\n81              if by1[i] == \"1\":\n82                  result[i] = \"N\"\n83          for i in range(len(by2)):\n84              if by2[i] == \"1\":\n85                  result[i] = \"S\"\n86      else:\n87          return \"IMPOSSIBLE\"\n88      if x != origX:\n89          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n90              if result[i]==\"W\":\n91                  result[i] = \"E\"\n92              elif result[i]==\"E\":\n93                  result[i] = \"W\"\n94      if y != origY:\n95          for i in xrange(len(result)):\n96              if result[i]==\"N\":\n97                  result[i] = \"S\"\n98              elif result[i]==\"S\":\n99                  result[i] = \"N\"\n100      return \"\".join(result)\n101  T = int(raw_input())\n102  for t in range(T):\n103      x,y = map(int,raw_input().split())\n104      print \"Case #{}: {}\".format(t+1, solve(x, y))\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(result,79)` in function `solve`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   def solve(kase):\n2       R, C, H, V = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())\n3       cakes = []\n4       for i in xrange(R):\n5           row = list(raw_input().strip())\n6           cakes.append(row)\n7       chips = []\n8       chip_rows = [0] * R\n9       chip_cols = [0] * C\n10      chips_cnt = 0\n11      for i in xrange(R):\n12          for j in xrange(C):\n13              if cakes[i][j] == '@':\n14                  chips_cnt += 1\n15                  chip_rows[i] += 1\n16                  chip_cols[j] += 1\n17      if chips_cnt == 0:\n18          print \"Case #{}: POSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n19          return\n20      parts = (H + 1) * (V + 1)\n21      if chips_cnt % parts != 0:\n22          print \"Case #{}: IMPOSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n23          return\n24      piece_chip = chips_cnt / parts\n25      rows_chips = piece_chip * (V + 1)\n26      cols_chips = piece_chip * (H + 1)\n27      hcuts = [0]\n28      vcuts = [0]\n29      chips_row_cnt = 0\n30      for i in xrange(R):\n31          chips_row_cnt += chip_rows[i]\n32          if chips_row_cnt < rows_chips:\n33              continue\n34          elif chips_row_cnt == rows_chips:\n35              chips_row_cnt = 0\n36              hcuts.append(i + 1)\n37          else:\n38              print \"Case #{}: IMPOSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n39              return\n40      chips_col_cnt = 0\n41      for i in xrange(C):\n42          chips_col_cnt += chip_cols[i]\n43          if chips_col_cnt < cols_chips:\n44              continue\n45          elif chips_col_cnt == cols_chips:\n46              chips_col_cnt = 0\n47              vcuts.append(i + 1)\n48          else:\n49              print \"Case #{}: IMPOSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n50              return\n51      for x in xrange(H):\n52          chips.append([])\n53          for y in xrange(V):\n54              chips[x].append(0)\n55              for i in xrange(hcuts[x], hcuts[x+1]):\n56                  for j in xrange(vcuts[y], vcuts[y+1]):\n57                      if cakes[i][j] == \"@\":\n58                          chips[x][y] += 1\n59              if chips[x][y] != piece_chip:\n60                  print \"Case #{}: IMPOSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n61                  return\n62      print \"Case #{}: POSSIBLE\".format(kase)\n63      return\n64  def main():\n65      T = int(raw_input())\n66      for kase in xrange(1, T + 1):\n67          solve(kase)\n68  if __name__ == '__main__':\n69      main()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(cols_chips,26)` in function `solve`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from __future__ import division\n2   import math\n3   import sys\n4   def printflush(x):\n5       print(x)\n6       sys.stdout.flush()\n7   def getline():\n8       return sys.stdin.readline().split()\n9   def getints():\n10      return [int(x) for x in getline()]\n11  def solvecase():\n12      vases = [None] + [[] for i in range(20)]\n13      peektime = [0 for i in range(21)]\n14      stuffV = None\n15      tokens = 0\n16      target = 1\n17      for d in range(1, 101):\n18          (dd,) = getints()\n19          assert(d == dd)\n20          tokens += 1\n21          if d <= 19:\n22              V = d\n23              P = 100\n24          elif d == 100:\n25              V = 20\n26              P = 100\n27          elif stuffV is not None:\n28              V = stuffV\n29              v = vases[V]\n30              sys.stderr.write(\"TARGET peektime: %s\\n\" % peektime[target])\n31              if peektime[target] <= d - 5:\n32                  V = target\n33                  P = 0\n34                  sys.stderr.write(\"PEEK TARGET instead\\n\")\n35              elif peektime[V] <= d - 30:\n36                  P = 0\n37                  sys.stderr.write(\"PEEK instead\\n\")\n38              else:\n39                  P = 1\n40                  while True:\n41                      if P not in v:\n42                          break\n43                      P += 1\n44          else:\n45              V = target\n46              P = 0\n47          printflush(\"{} {}\".format(V, P))\n48          stuffV = None\n49          if P == 0:\n50              L = getints()\n51              L = [x for x in L[1:] if x < 100]\n52              vases[V] = L\n53              peektime[V] = d\n54          elif P != 100:\n55              vases[V].append(P)\n56              tokens += 1\n57          m = min(len(vases[V]) for V in range(1, 21))\n58          sys.stderr.write(\"day = %s; m = %s; target = %s\\n\" % (d, m, target))\n59          sys.stderr.write(\"sizes: %s\\n\" % \" \".join(str(len(vases[V])) for V in range(1, 21)))\n60          if len(vases[target]) == m:\n61              m2 = 10000\n62              mtime = 0\n63              for V in range(1, 21):\n64                  if V == target:\n65                      continue\n66                  if len(vases[V]) < m2 or (len(vases[V]) == m2 and peektime[V] > mtime):\n67                      stuffV = V\n68                      m2 = len(vases[V])\n69                      mtime = peektime[V]\n70              sys.stderr.write(\"STUFFING vase %s\\n\" % stuffV)\n71          else:\n72              for target in range(1, 21):\n73                  if len(vases[target]) == m:\n74                      break\n75              sys.stderr.write(\"NEW target = %s\\n\" % target)\n76  (T,) = getints()\n77  for i in range(T):\n78      ans = solvecase()\n79      sys.stderr.write(\"*\" * 80 + \"\\n\")\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(mtime,69)` in function `solvecase`?

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from __future__ import print_function\n2   import sys\n3   import time\n4   sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)\n5   inputFileName = None\n6   outputFileName = None\n7   if inputFileName is not None:\n8       outputFileName = inputFileName[:-3] + \".out\"\n9   import platform\n10  global MY_DEBUG\n11  MY_DEBUG = platform.node().lower() in map(lambda s: s.lower(), ['HOMEPC3', 'lenovo'])\n12  logF = None\n13  if MY_DEBUG:\n14      logF = open(\"run.log\", 'w')\n15  def dbg_print(s):\n16      if MY_DEBUG:\n17          logF.write('{0}\\n'.format(s))\n18          logF.flush()\n19  startTime = time.time()\n20  dbg_print(startTime)\n21  def runSingleTest(inpF, outF):\n22      line = inpF.readline()\n23      tokens = line.split()\n24      a_exc = int(tokens[0])\n25      b_inc = int(tokens[1])\n26      line = inpF.readline()\n27      n = int(line)\n28      for i in xrange(n):\n29          guess = (a_exc + b_inc + 1) / 2\n30          print(guess, file=outF)\n31          line = inpF.readline_safe()\n32          if 'CORRECT' == line:\n33              return\n34          elif 'TOO_SMALL' == line:\n35              a_exc = guess + 1\n36          elif 'TOO_BIG' == line:\n37              b_inc = guess - 1\n38          else:\n39              dbg_print(\"Unexpected line '{0}'\".format(line))\n40              raise RuntimeError(\"Unexpected line '{0}'\".format(line))\n41      raise RuntimeError(\"AAAAA\")\n42  class InpFWrapper:\n43      def __init__(self, inpF):\n44          self.inpF = inpF\n45      def readline(self):\n46          line = self.inpF.readline()\n47          dbg_print(\"Read line is '{0}'\".format(line.replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")))\n48          return line\n49      def readline_safe(self):\n50          line = self.inpF.readline()\n51          dbg_print(\"Read line safe is '{0}'\".format(line.replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")))\n52          return line[0:-1] if (line[-1] == '\\n') else line\n53  class OutFWrapper:\n54      def __init__(self, outF):\n55          self.outF = outF\n56      def __getattr__(self, name):\n57          return getattr(self.outF, name)\n58      def write(self, str):\n59          dbg_print(\"Writing '{0}'\".format(str.replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")))\n60          self.outF.write(str)\n61          self.outF.flush()\n62  def myMain(inpF, outF):\n63      if (MY_DEBUG):\n64          dbg_print('input = {0}, out = {1}'.format(inputFileName, outputFileName))\n65      inpF = InpFWrapper(inpF)\n66      outF = OutFWrapper(outF)\n67      line = inpF.readline()\n68      testsCount = int(line)\n69      for i in xrange(1, testsCount + 1):\n70          dbg_print('--------  {0}/{1} {2} --------------------------'.format(i, testsCount, (time.time() - startTime)))\n71          runSingleTest(inpF, outF)\n72          dbg_print('--------  {0}/{1} {2} --------------------------'.format(i, testsCount, (time.time() - startTime)))\n73  if inputFileName is not None:\n74      with open(inputFileName) as inpF:\n75          with open(outputFileName, 'w') as outF:\n76              myMain(inpF, outF)\n77  else:\n78      myMain(sys.stdin, sys.stdout)\n79  dbg_print(\"Finished!!!!

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries.

Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`?

However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability.

Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from

Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   from

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`. Line 5: `i` iterates over 0 to 3.\n  - If it is from line 1: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, it is initialized at line 1 without any other data dependencies.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```Python\n1   def solve(B):\n2       if B[0] == 0 or B[-1] == 0:\n3           return 'IMPOSSIBLE', None\n4       grid = []\n5       C = len(B)\n6       grid = []\n7       for j in range(C):\n8           row = []\n9           for i in range(C):\n10              row.append('.')\n11          grid.append(row)\n12      shadowed = [False] * len(C)\n13      shadowed[0] = True\n14      B[0] -= 1\n15      B[-1] -= 1\n16      i = 0\n17      for i in range(C):\n18          if B[i] == 0 and shadowed[i]:\n19              continue\n20          if B[i] > 0 and not shadowed[i]:\n21              unshadowed_balls = 0\n22              j = i - 1\n23              l = 1\n24              while j >= 1 and not shadowed[j]:\n25                  grid[l][j] = '\\\\'\n26                  shadowed[j] = True\n27                  unshadowed_balls += 1\n28                  l += 1\n29                  j -= 1\n30              if B[i] <= unshadowed_balls:\n31                  excess_balls = unshadowed_balls - B[i] + 1\n32                  j = i\n33                  while excess_balls > 1:\n34                      j -= 1\n35                      excess_balls -= 1\n36                      shadowed[j] = False\n37              else:\n38                  B[i] -= (unshadowed_balls + 1)\n39                  shadowed[i] = True\n40          if B[i] > 0 and shadowed[i]:\n41              r = B[i]\n42              j = i + 1\n43              l = 1\n44              while j < (C - 1) and shadowed[j]:\n45                  grid[l][j] = '/'\n46                  l += 1\n47                  j += 1\n48              while j < (C - 1) and r > 0:\n49                  grid[l][j] = '/'\n50                  shadowed[j] = True\n51                  r -= 1\n52                  l += 1\n53                  j += 1\n54      ans = []\n55      for index in range(1, C):\n56          row = grid[index]\n57          include_row = False\n58          for cell in row:\n59              if cell == '\\\\' or cell == '/':\n60                  include_row = True\n61                  break\n62          if include_row:\n63              ans.append(row)\n64          else:\n65              break\n66      ans = [['.' for i in range(C)]] + ans\n67      return len(ans), ans\n68  def lay_right_ramp(i, grid, shadowed):\n69      pass\n70  def lay_left_ramp(i, grid, shadowed):\n71      pass\n72  def main():\n73      T = int(raw_input())\n74      t = 1\n75      while t <= T:\n76          S = int(raw_input())\n77          B_raw = raw_input().split()\n78          B = [int(x) for x in B_raw]\n79          res, grid = solve(B)\n80          print \"Case #{0}: {1}\".format(str(t), str(res))\n81          if grid:\n82              i = len(grid) - 1\n83              while i >= 0:\n84                  print ''.join(grid[i])\n85                  i = i - 1\n86          t += 1\n87  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n88      main()\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have data dependence over `(excess_balls,35)` in function `solve`?

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4.

Perform a **static** data-dependence analysis on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n\n## 1. Data Dependence Definition\n\n   Data dependence captures the influence of data flow between variables.\n\n   We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` defined or updated at `lineNumber`.\n\n   >  **Direct Data Dependence**\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is **directly** data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if `lineA` writes to `varA`. Then, without overwritting the value of `varA`, `lineB` reads `varA` and compute the value of `varB`. In other words, the value of `(varB,lineB)` relies on the value produced at `(varA,lineA)`. In addition, changing the execution order of `(varA,lineA)` and `(varB,lineB)` would alter their results.\n\n\n   A variable instance `(varB,lineB)` is data-dependent on `(varA,lineA)` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** data dependencies from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)`. This is equivalent to saying that `(varA,lineA)` has data dependence over `(varB,lineB)`, meaning the value written at `(varA,lineA)` can propagate to `(varB,lineB)` through a sequence of read/write operations.\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\n   When asked \"Which variable instances have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n  If you believe there is no variables have data dependence over `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n   ```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": []\n   }\n   ```\n  \n\n## 3. Intraprocedural Data Dependence\n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1    total = 0\n2    value = 1\n3    step = value\n4    if step > 1:\n5        value += 3\n6    while total <= 10:\n7        total += value\n8        difference = total - step\n9        step += 1\n10   final_result = total * 2\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(step,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `step += 1`, meaning `(step,9)` is directly data-dependent on `(step,3)` (or `(step,9)` itself) because step is updated based on its previous value.\n- Line 3: `step = value`, meaning `(step,3)` is directly data-dependent on `(value,2)`.\nTherefore, there exists a transitive data dependence chain from `(value,2)` to `(step,9)` through `(step,3)`. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"step\", 9],\n      [\"step\", 3],\n      [\"value\", 2],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.2 \nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(total,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `total += value`, meaning `(total,7)` reads from `total` at line 1 or 7 (itself), and `value` from either `(value,2)` or `(value,5)`.\n- Line 5: `value` is updated in `value += 3`, meaning `(value,5)` depends on `(value,2)` (or `(value,5)` itself). However, this update is inside an if statement, which means it may or may not execute depending on runtime conditions.\n- Line 2: value is initialized at `(value,2)`.\n\n\nAt this point, whether `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)` depends on whether line 4 (`if step>1`) is `true`. Since this is a static analysis, all possible paths are considered without analyzing actual reachability. This means line 5 is treated as both possibly executed and possibly not executed.\n\n- If line 4 evaluates to `true`, `(total,7)` depends on `(value,5)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (value,5) -> (total,7)`. \n- If line 4 evaluates to `false`, `(total,7)` directly depends on `(value,2)`, forming the trace: `(value,2) -> (total,7)`\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"total\", 1],\n      [\"total\", 7],\n      [\"value\", 5],\n      [\"value\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1    arr = [1, 2, 3]\n2    x = 5\n3    if x > 2:\n4        arr[0] = x   \n5    for i in range(3):\n6        arr[i] += 1  \n7        temp = arr[i]  \n8        y = temp + 1  \n9    result = arr[-1]\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(arr,6)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n\n**Analysis**\n- Line 6: `arr[i] += 1` modifies `arr[i]`, but i varies during the loop execution.\n   - If `i == 0`, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`, which was updated in line 4 (or line 6 itself), establishing a dependence chain `(arr,4)` -> `(arr,6)`.\n   - If `i != 0`, `arr[i]` does not refer to `arr[0]`, meaning it depend on `(arr,1)` (or `(arr,6)` itself), not `(arr,4)`.\n   - However, since static analysis considers all possible paths without resolving i\u2019s runtime value, we must assume `arr[i]` could be `arr[0]`, leading to a possible dependence.\n- Line 4: `arr[0] = x`, meaning `(arr,4)` depends on `(x,2)`.\n- Line 2: `x` is initialized at `(x,2)`.\n\n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"arr\", 4],\n      [\"arr\", 1],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n      [\"x\", 2]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(temp,7)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 7: `temp = arr[i]`, meaning temp depends on `i`, since `i` determines which element of arr is accessed. And `arr[i]` can only refer to `(arr,6)` as they have the same index.\n- Line 5: `i` is initialized and iterates over the range 0 to 3.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"DataDependenceSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 6],\n      [\"i\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.3:\nWhich variable instances have data dependence over `(result,9)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 9: `result = arr[-1]`, meaning result depends on `arr[-1]`, which is arr[2], possibly get updated at line 6 (or line 1).\n  - If it is from line 6: `arr[i] += 1`, `arr[i]` is modified based on the value of `i`.
