Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   #define max(a,b) ((a)>=(b)?(a):(b))\n4   int dp[3001][3001];\n5   char buf[30], *p;\n6   int getint()\n7   {\n8   \tint n = 0;\n9   \twhile (*p >= '0') n = (n<<3) + (n<<1) + (*p++ & 0xf);\n10  \treturn n;\n11  }\n12  int main()\n13  {\t\n14  \tint a[3001];\n15  \tint b[3001];\n16  \tint n, t, s, i, j, k, ans;\n17  \tfgets(p=buf, 30, stdin);\n18  \tn = getint();\n19  \tp++;\n20  \tt = getint();\n21  \tp++;\n22  \ts = getint();\n23  \tfor (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n24  \t\tfgets(p=buf, 30, stdin);\n25  \t\ta[i] = getint();\n26  \t\tp++;\n27  \t\tb[i] = getint();\n28  \t}\n29  \tans = 0;\n30  \tfor (i = 1; i <= n; i++) \n31  \t\tfor (j = 1; j <= t; j++) {\n32  \t\t\tdp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);\n33  \t\t\tk = j-b[i];\n34  \t\t\tif (k >= 0 && (s <= k || j <= s))\n35  \t\t\t\tdp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + a[i]);\n36  \t\t\tans = max(ans, dp[i][j]);\n37  \t\t}\n38  \tprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n39  \treturn 0;\n40  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(k,33)` in function `main`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop).

Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   void MakeCostMinimum(int p, int q, int r)\n4   {\n5       int minimumcost = (q - p) + (r - q);\n6       if (minimumcost < 0)\n7           minimumcost = minimumcost * (-1);\n8       else\n9           ;\n10      printf(\"%d\\n\", minimumcost);\n11  }\n12  void Compare3Figures(int a, int b, int c)\n13  {\n14      if (b < a && a < c)\n15      {\n16          int tmp = a;\n17          a = b;\n18          b = tmp;\n19      }\n20      else if (b < a && c < b)\n21      {\n22          int tmptwo = a;\n23          a = c;\n24          c = tmptwo;\n25      }\n26      else if (a < b && c < b && a < c)\n27      {\n28          int tmpthree = b;\n29          b = c;\n30          c = tmpthree;\n31      }\n32      else if (a < b && c < a)\n33      {\n34          int tmpfour = a;\n35          a = c;\n36          c = b;\n37          b = tmpfour;\n38      }\n39      else if (b < a && b < c && c < a)\n40      {\n41          int tmpfive = a;\n42          a = b;\n43          b = c;\n44          c = tmpfive;\n45      }\n46      MakeCostMinimum(a, b, c);\n47  }\n48  int main(int argc, char *argv[])\n49  {\n50      int A = 0;\n51      int B = 0;\n52      int C = 0;\n53      do\n54      {\n55          scanf(\"%d\", &A);\n56      } while (A < 1 || 100 < A);\n57      do\n58      {\n59          scanf(\"%d\", &B);\n60      } while (B < 1 || 100 < B);\n61      do\n62      {\n63          scanf(\"%d\", &C);\n64      } while (C < 1 || 100 < C);\n65      Compare3Figures(A, B, C);\n66  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(c,44)` in function `Compare3Figures`?

Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<string.h>\n3   long long int modpow(long long int a, long long int n, long long int p)\n4   {\n5   \tif (n < 0)return 0;\n6   \tlong long int res = 1;\n7   \twhile (n > 0)\n8   \t{\n9   \t\tif (n % 2 == 1)\n10  \t\t\tres = res * a % p;\n11  \t\ta = a * a % p;\n12  \t\tn /= 2;\n13  \t}\n14  \treturn res;\n15  }\n16  int main()\n17  {\n18  \tchar s[100005];\n19  \tscanf(\"%s\", s);\n20  \tlong long int i, n = strlen(s);\n21  \tlong long int ca[100005], cha[100005];\n22  \tca[0] = cha[0] = 0;\n23  \tfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n24  \t{\n25  \t\tif (s[i] == 'A')\n26  \t\t{\n27  \t\t\tca[i + 1] = ca[i] + 1;\n28  \t\t\tcha[i + 1] = cha[i];\n29  \t\t}\n30  \t\telse if (s[i] == '?')\n31  \t\t{\n32  \t\t\tca[i + 1] = ca[i];\n33  \t\t\tcha[i + 1] = cha[i] + 1;\n34  \t\t}\n35  \t\telse\n36  \t\t{\n37  \t\t\tca[i + 1] = ca[i];\n38  \t\t\tcha[i + 1] = cha[i];\n39  \t\t}\n40  \t}\n41  \tlong long int cc[100005], chc[100005];\n42  \tcc[n] = chc[n] = 0;\n43  \tfor (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n44  \t{\n45  \t\tif (s[i] == 'C')\n46  \t\t{\n47  \t\t\tcc[i] = cc[i + 1] + 1;\n48  \t\t\tchc[i] = chc[i + 1];\n49  \t\t}\n50  \t\telse if (s[i] == '?')\n51  \t\t{\n52  \t\t\tcc[i] = cc[i + 1];\n53  \t\t\tchc[i] = chc[i + 1] + 1;\n54  \t\t}\n55  \t\telse\n56  \t\t{\n57  \t\t\tcc[i] = cc[i + 1];\n58  \t\t\tchc[i] = chc[i + 1];\n59  \t\t}\n60  \t}\n61  \tlong long int p = 1000000007;\n62  \tlong long int ans = 0;\n63  \tfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n64  \t\tif (s[i] == 'B' || s[i] == '?')\n65  \t\t\tans = (ans + ((ca[i] * modpow(3, cha[i], p) % p + cha[i] * modpow(3, cha[i] - 1, p) % p) % p) * ((cc[i + 1] * modpow(3, chc[i + 1], p) % p + chc[i + 1] * modpow(3, chc[i + 1] - 1, p) % p) % p)) % p;\n66  \tprintf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n67  \treturn 0;\n68  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(chc,53)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   long long int gcd(long long int a, long long int b)\n3   {\n4   \tlong long int r = a % b;\n5   \twhile (r > 0)\n6   \t{\n7   \t\ta = b;\n8   \t\tb = r;\n9   \t\tr = a % b;\n10  \t}\n11  \treturn b;\n12  }\n13  int main()\n14  {\n15  \tlong long int n;\n16  \tscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n17  \tlong long int i, j, k;\n18  \tchar s[100];\n19  \tlong long int a[200005];\n20  \tfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n21  \t{\n22  \t\tscanf(\"%s\", s);\n23  \t\ta[i] = 0;\n24  \t\tk = 0;\n25  \t\tfor (j = 0; s[j] != '\\0'; j++)\n26  \t\t{\n27  \t\t\tif (s[j] != '.')\n28  \t\t\t{\n29  \t\t\t\ta[i] = 10 * a[i] + (long long int)(s[j] - '0');\n30  \t\t\t\tif (k > 0)\n31  \t\t\t\t\tk++;\n32  \t\t\t}\n33  \t\t\telse\n34  \t\t\t\tk = 1;\n35  \t\t}\n36  \t\tif (k == 0)\n37  \t\t\tk = 1;\n38  \t\tfor (; k < 10; k++)\n39  \t\t\ta[i] *= 10;\n40  \t}\n41  \tlong long int q = 100000;\n42  \tfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n43  \t{\n44  \t\tif (a[i] % q > 0)\n45  \t\t\ta[i] = -1;\n46  \t\telse\n47  \t\t\ta[i] = a[i] / q;\n48  \t}\n49  \tq = 100000000;\n50  \tlong long int b[10004];\n51  \tj = 0;\n52  \tfor (i = 1; i * i <= q; i++)\n53  \t{\n54  \t\tif (q % i == 0)\n55  \t\t{\n56  \t\t\tb[j] = i;\n57  \t\t\tj++;\n58  \t\t}\n59  \t}\n60  \ti--;\n61  \tif (i * i == q)\n62  \t\ti--;\n63  \tfor (; i > 0; i--)\n64  \t{\n65  \t\tif (q % i == 0)\n66  \t\t{\n67  \t\t\tb[j] = q / i;\n68  \t\t\tj++;\n69  \t\t}\n70  \t}\n71  \tlong long int min, mid, max;\n72  \tlong long int c[10004];\n73  \tfor (i = 0; i < j; i++)\n74  \t\tc[i] = 0;\n75  \tlong long int ans = 0;\n76  \tlong long int l;\n77  \tfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n78  \t{\n79  \t\tif (a[i] < 0)\n80  \t\t\tcontinue;\n81  \t\tl = q / gcd(q, a[i]);\n82  \t\tmin = -1;\n83  \t\tmax = j;\n84  \t\twhile (max - min > 1)\n85  \t\t{\n86  \t\t\tmid = (max + min) / 2;\n87  \t\t\tif (b[mid] < l)\n88  \t\t\t\tmin = mid;\n89  \t\t\telse\n90  \t\t\t\tmax = mid;\n91  \t\t}\n92  \t\tans += c[max];\n93  \t\tfor (k = 0; k < j; k++)\n94  \t\t\tif (a[i] % b[k] == 0)\n95  \t\t\t\tc[k]++;\n96  \t}\n97  \tprintf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n98  \treturn 0;\n99  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,60)` in function `main`?

When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <time.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   #include <string.h>\n6   #define max(p,q)((p)>(q)?(p):(q))\n7   #define min(p,q)((p)<(q)?(p):(q))\n8   int gcd(int m,int n){if((0==m)||(0==n))return 0;while(m!=n)if(m>n)m=m-n;else n=n-m;return m;}\n9   int lcm(int m,int n){if((0==m)||(0==n))return 0;return(m*n/gcd(m, n));}\n10  int fact(int x){if(x==1) return(x);else return(x*fact(x-1));}\n11  int ruijou(int base,int exponent){int i,answer=1;i=exponent;while(i!=0){answer=answer*base;--i;}return answer;}\n12  long long int llgcd(long long int m,long long int n){if((0==m)||(0==n))return 0;while(m!=n)if(m>n)m=m-n;else n=n-m;return m;}\n13  long long int lllcm(long long int m,long long int n){if((0==m)||(0==n))return 0;return(m*n/llgcd(m, n));}\n14  long long int llfact(long long int x){if(x==1) return(x);else return(x*llfact(x-1));}\n15  int llruijou(long long int base,long long int exponent){long long int i,answer=1;i=exponent;while(i!=0){answer=answer*base;--i;}return answer;}\n16  int main()\n17  {\n18    long long int n,m,k,i,j,aa,num,ans;\n19    scanf(\"%lld %lld %lld\", &n, &m, &k);\n20    long long int a[200010],b[200010];\n21    a[0] = b[0] = 0;\n22    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n23      scanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\n24    }\n25    for(j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n26      scanf(\"%lld\", &b[j]);\n27    }\n28    aa=n+m;\n29    i=1;\n30    j=1;\n31    ans=0;\n32    while(num<=k){\n33      if(a[i]<=b[j] && i<=n && j<=m){\n34        num+=a[i];\n35        i++;\n36        ans++;\n37      }\n38      else if(a[i]>=b[j] && i<=n && j<=m){\n39        num+=b[j];\n40        j++;\n41        ans++;\n42      }\n43      else if(i==n+1 && j<=m){\n44        num+=b[j];\n45        j++;\n46        ans++;\n47      }\n48      else if(i<=n && j==m+1){\n49        num+=a[i];\n50        i++;\n51        ans++;\n52      }\n53      else if(i==n+1 && j==m+1){\n54        ans++;\n55        break;\n56      }\n57      else{\n58        ans++;\n59        printf(\"kono baai ha nai hazu\\n\");;\n60      }\n61    }\n62    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans-1);\n63    return 0;\n64  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(num,39)` in function `main`?

Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   int int_sort( const void * a , const void * b ) {\n4     if( *(int*)a < *(int*)b ) {\n5       return -1;\n6     } else if( *(int*)a == *(int*)b ) {\n7       return 0;\n8     }\n9     return 1;\n10  }\n11  int main(void) {\n12    int N;\n13    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n14    int A[100000];\n15    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n16      scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n17    }\n18    if(N == 2) {\n19      printf(\"%d\\n\", abs(A[0] - A[1]));\n20      return 0;\n21    }\n22    qsort((void*)A, N, sizeof(A[0]), int_sort);\n23    int B[100000];\n24    int pos = N / 2;\n25    int beg, end;\n26    int flag;\n27    int offset;\n28    B[pos] = A[0];\n29    beg = 1;\n30    end = N - 1;\n31    flag = 1;\n32    offset = 1;\n33    while(1) {\n34      if(flag == 1) {\n35        B[pos-offset] = A[end--];\n36        if(end < beg) break;\n37        B[pos+offset] = A[end--];\n38        if(end < beg) break;\n39        flag = 0;\n40      } else {\n41        B[pos-offset] = A[beg++];\n42        if(end < beg) break;\n43        B[pos+offset] = A[beg++];\n44        if(end < beg) break;\n45        flag = 1;\n46      }\n47      offset++;\n48    }\n49    int C[100000];\n50    C[pos] = A[N-1];\n51    beg = 0;\n52    end = N - 2;\n53    flag = 0;\n54    offset = 1;\n55    while(1) {\n56      if(flag == 1) {\n57        C[pos-offset] = A[end--];\n58        if(end < beg) break;\n59        C[pos+offset] = A[end--];\n60        if(end < beg) break;\n61        flag = 0;\n62      } else {\n63        C[pos-offset] = A[beg++];\n64        if(end < beg) break;\n65        C[pos+offset] = A[beg++];\n66        if(end < beg) break;\n67        flag = 1;\n68      }\n69      offset++;\n70    }\n71    long long int sumB = 0;\n72    for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n73      sumB += abs(B[i-1] - B[i]);\n74    }\n75    long long int sumC = 0;\n76    for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n77      sumC += abs(C[i-1] - C[i]);\n78    }\n79  #if 0\n80    printf(\"B[]=\");\n81    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n82      printf(\"%d \", B[i]);\n83    }\n84    printf(\": sum=%lld\\n\", sumB);\n85    printf(\"C[]=\");\n86    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n87      printf(\"%d \", C[i]);\n88    }\n89    printf(\": sum=%lld\\n\", sumC);\n90  #endif\n91    if(sumB < sumC)\n92      printf(\"%lld\\n\", sumC);\n93    else\n94      printf(\"%lld\\n\", sumB);\n95    return 0;\n96  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(C,57)` in function `main`?

Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   int int_sort( const void * a , const void * b ) {\n4     if( *(int*)a < *(int*)b ) {\n5       return -1;\n6     } else if( *(int*)a == *(int*)b ) {\n7       return 0;\n8     }\n9     return 1;\n10  }\n11  int main(void) {\n12    int N;\n13    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n14    int A[100000];\n15    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n16      scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n17    }\n18    if(N == 2) {\n19      printf(\"%d\\n\", abs(A[0] - A[1]));\n20      return 0;\n21    }\n22    qsort((void*)A, N, sizeof(A[0]), int_sort);\n23    int B[100000];\n24    int pos = N / 2;\n25    int beg, end;\n26    int flag;\n27    int offset;\n28    B[pos] = A[0];\n29    beg = 1;\n30    end = N - 1;\n31    flag = 1;\n32    offset = 1;\n33    while(1) {\n34      if(flag == 1) {\n35        B[pos-offset] = A[end--];\n36        if(end < beg) break;\n37        B[pos+offset] = A[end--];\n38        if(end < beg) break;\n39        flag = 0;\n40      } else {\n41        B[pos-offset] = A[beg++];\n42        if(end < beg) break;\n43        B[pos+offset] = A[beg++];\n44        if(end < beg) break;\n45        flag = 1;\n46      }\n47      offset++;\n48    }\n49    int C[100000];\n50    C[pos] = A[N-1];\n51    beg = 0;\n52    end = N - 2;\n53    flag = 0;\n54    offset = 1;\n55    while(1) {\n56      if(flag == 1) {\n57        C[pos-offset] = A[end--];\n58        if(end < beg) break;\n59        C[pos+offset] = A[end--];\n60        if(end < beg) break;\n61        flag = 0;\n62      } else {\n63        C[pos-offset] = A[beg++];\n64        if(end < beg) break;\n65        C[pos+offset] = A[beg++];\n66        if(end < beg) break;\n67        flag = 1;\n68      }\n69      offset++;\n70    }\n71    long long int sumB = 0;\n72    for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n73      sumB += abs(B[i-1] - B[i]);\n74    }\n75    long long int sumC = 0;\n76    for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n77      sumC += abs(C[i-1] - C[i]);\n78    }\n79  #if 0\n80    printf(\"B[]=\");\n81    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n82      printf(\"%d \", B[i]);\n83    }\n84    printf(\": sum=%lld\\n\", sumB);\n85    printf(\"C[]=\");\n86    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n87      printf(\"%d \", C[i]);\n88    }\n89    printf(\": sum=%lld\\n\", sumC);\n90  #endif\n91    if(sumB < sumC)\n92      printf(\"%lld\\n\", sumC);\n93    else\n94      printf(\"%lld\\n\", sumB);\n95    return 0;\n96  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(pos,24)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   int main()\n3   {\n4   \tint q;\n5   \tscanf(\"%d\", &q);\n6   \tint n = 0;\n7   \tlong long int a[200005], b = 0;\n8   \tlong long int x, y, z;\n9   \tint i, j;\n10  \tlong long int m;\n11  \tlong long int ans;\n12  \tfor (i = 0; i < q; i++)\n13  \t{\n14  \t\tscanf(\"%lld\", &x);\n15  \t\tif (x == 1)\n16  \t\t{\n17  \t\t\tscanf(\"%lld %lld\", &y, &z);\n18  \t\t\tif (n == 0)\n19  \t\t\t\ta[0] = y;\n20  \t\t\telse\n21  \t\t\t{\n22  \t\t\t\tfor (j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--)\n23  \t\t\t\t{\n24  \t\t\t\t\tif (a[j] > y)\n25  \t\t\t\t\t\ta[j + 1] = a[j];\n26  \t\t\t\t\telse\n27  \t\t\t\t\t{\n28  \t\t\t\t\t\ta[j + 1] = y;\n29  \t\t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n30  \t\t\t\t\t}\n31  \t\t\t\t\tif (j == 0)\n32  \t\t\t\t\t\ta[0] = y;\n33  \t\t\t\t}\n34  \t\t\t}\n35  \t\t\tn++;\n36  \t\t\tb += z;\n37  \t\t}\n38  \t\telse\n39  \t\t{\n40  \t\t\tm = a[(n - 1) / 2];\n41  \t\t\tans = b;\n42  \t\t\tfor (j = 0; j < n; j++)\n43  \t\t\t\tif (m - a[j] < 0)\n44  \t\t\t\t\tans += - (m - a[j]);\n45  \t\t\t\telse\n46  \t\t\t\t\tans += m - a[j];\n47  \t\t\tprintf(\"%lld %lld\\n\", m, ans);\n48  \t\t}\n49  \t}\n50  \treturn 0;\n51  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,12)` in function `main`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   void judge(int x){\n3   \tif(x == 1){\n4   \t\tprintf(\"Yes\\n\");\n5   \t}else if(x == 0){\n6   \t\tprintf(\"No\\n\");\n7   \t} \n8   }\n9   int main(void) {\n10  \tchar word[100];\n11  \tscanf(\"%s\",&word);\n12  \tint i=0;\n13  \tint flagC=0;\n14  \tint flagF=0;\n15  \tint SuccessFlag=0;\n16  \twhile(word[i]!='\\0'){\n17  \t\tif(word[i]=='C'){\n18  \t\t\tflagC = i;\n19  \t\t\tSuccessFlag++;\n20  \t\t}else if(word[i]=='F'){\n21  \t\t\tflagF = i;\n22  \t\t}\n23  \t\ti++;\n24  \t}\n25  \tif(SuccessFlag>1 && flagC < flagF){\n26  \t\tjudge(1);\n27  \t}else{\n28  \t\tjudge(0);\n29  \t}\n30  \treturn 0;\n31  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,23)` in function `main`?

Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   int descending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n6       if (*(int*)a > *(int*)b){\n7           return -1;\n8       }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n9           return 0;\n10      }else{\n11          return 1;\n12      }\n13  }\n14  int ascending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n15      if (*(int*)a < *(int*)b){\n16          return -1;\n17      }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n18          return 0;\n19      }else{\n20          return 1;\n21      }\n22  }\n23  int lower_bound(int *a, int n, int key){\n24      int left, mid, right;\n25      left = 0, right = n;\n26      mid = (left + right)/2;\n27      while ((left+1 != mid || mid+1 != right) && mid != left){\n28          if (key > a[mid]){\n29              left = mid;\n30          }else{\n31              right = mid+1;\n32          }\n33          mid = (left + right)/2;\n34      }\n35      if (a[left] >= key)return left;\n36      if (a[mid] >= key)return mid;\n37      if (a[right] >= key)return right;\n38      return n;\n39  }\n40  unsigned long  gcd(unsigned long x, unsigned long y){\n41      if (y == 0){ \n42          return x;\n43      }else if (x > y){\n44          return gcd(y, x % y);\n45      }else{\n46          return gcd(x, y % x);\n47      }\n48  }\n49  long long factorial(int x){\n50      long long rtn = 1;\n51      int i;\n52      for (i = x; i > 1; i--){\n53          rtn = (rtn*i);\n54      }\n55      return rtn;\n56  }\n57  int main(void){\n58      int h, w;\n59      long long square[3];\n60      long long min, max;\n61      long long ans = 10000000000000;\n62      scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n63      for (int i = 1; i < h; i++){\n64          square[0] = (long long)i * w;\n65          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)*(w/2);\n66          square[2] = (long long)(h-i)*(w-w/2);\n67          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n68          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n69              if (min > square[j]){\n70                  min = square[j];\n71              }\n72              if (max < square[j]){\n73                  max = square[j];\n74              }\n75          }\n76          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n77              ans = llabs(max-min);\n78          }\n79          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)/2*w;\n80          square[2] = (long long)((h-i)-(h-i)/2)*w;\n81          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n82          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n83              if (min > square[j]){\n84                  min = (long long)square[j];\n85              }\n86              if (max < square[j]){\n87                  max = (long long)square[j];\n88              }\n89          }\n90          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n91              ans = llabs(max-min);\n92          }\n93      }\n94      for (int i = 0; i < w; i++){\n95          square[0] = (long long)i*h;\n96          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)*(h/2);\n97          square[2] = (long long)(w-i)*(h-h/2);\n98          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n99          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n100              if (min > square[j]){\n101                  min = (long long)square[j];\n102              }\n103              if (max < square[j]){\n104                  max = (long long)square[j];\n105              }\n106          }\n107          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n108              ans = llabs(max-min);\n109          }\n110          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)/2*h;\n111          square[2] = (long long)((w-i)-(w-i)/2)*h;\n112          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n113          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n114              if (min > square[j]){\n115                  min = (long long)square[j];\n116              }\n117              if (max < square[j]){\n118                  max = (long long)square[j];\n119              }\n120          }\n121          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n122              ans = llabs(max-min);\n123          }\n124      }\n125      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n126      return 0;\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(j,68)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   int descending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n6       if (*(int*)a > *(int*)b){\n7           return -1;\n8       }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n9           return 0;\n10      }else{\n11          return 1;\n12      }\n13  }\n14  int ascending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n15      if (*(int*)a < *(int*)b){\n16          return -1;\n17      }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n18          return 0;\n19      }else{\n20          return 1;\n21      }\n22  }\n23  int lower_bound(int *a, int n, int key){\n24      int left, mid, right;\n25      left = 0, right = n;\n26      mid = (left + right)/2;\n27      while ((left+1 != mid || mid+1 != right) && mid != left){\n28          if (key > a[mid]){\n29              left = mid;\n30          }else{\n31              right = mid+1;\n32          }\n33          mid = (left + right)/2;\n34      }\n35      if (a[left] >= key)return left;\n36      if (a[mid] >= key)return mid;\n37      if (a[right] >= key)return right;\n38      return n;\n39  }\n40  unsigned long  gcd(unsigned long x, unsigned long y){\n41      if (y == 0){ \n42          return x;\n43      }else if (x > y){\n44          return gcd(y, x % y);\n45      }else{\n46          return gcd(x, y % x);\n47      }\n48  }\n49  long long factorial(int x){\n50      long long rtn = 1;\n51      int i;\n52      for (i = x; i > 1; i--){\n53          rtn = (rtn*i);\n54      }\n55      return rtn;\n56  }\n57  int main(void){\n58      int h, w;\n59      long long square[3];\n60      long long min, max;\n61      long long ans = 10000000000000;\n62      scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n63      for (int i = 1; i < h; i++){\n64          square[0] = (long long)i * w;\n65          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)*(w/2);\n66          square[2] = (long long)(h-i)*(w-w/2);\n67          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n68          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n69              if (min > square[j]){\n70                  min = square[j];\n71              }\n72              if (max < square[j]){\n73                  max = square[j];\n74              }\n75          }\n76          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n77              ans = llabs(max-min);\n78          }\n79          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)/2*w;\n80          square[2] = (long long)((h-i)-(h-i)/2)*w;\n81          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n82          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n83              if (min > square[j]){\n84                  min = (long long)square[j];\n85              }\n86              if (max < square[j]){\n87                  max = (long long)square[j];\n88              }\n89          }\n90          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n91              ans = llabs(max-min);\n92          }\n93      }\n94      for (int i = 0; i < w; i++){\n95          square[0] = (long long)i*h;\n96          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)*(h/2);\n97          square[2] = (long long)(w-i)*(h-h/2);\n98          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n99          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n100              if (min > square[j]){\n101                  min = (long long)square[j];\n102              }\n103              if (max < square[j]){\n104                  max = (long long)square[j];\n105              }\n106          }\n107          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n108              ans = llabs(max-min);\n109          }\n110          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)/2*h;\n111          square[2] = (long long)((w-i)-(w-i)/2)*h;\n112          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n113          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n114              if (min > square[j]){\n115                  min = (long long)square[j];\n116              }\n117              if (max < square[j]){\n118                  max = (long long)square[j];\n119              }\n120          }\n121          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n122              ans = llabs(max-min);\n123          }\n124      }\n125      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n126      return 0;\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(min,70)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   int descending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n6       if (*(int*)a > *(int*)b){\n7           return -1;\n8       }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n9           return 0;\n10      }else{\n11          return 1;\n12      }\n13  }\n14  int ascending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n15      if (*(int*)a < *(int*)b){\n16          return -1;\n17      }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n18          return 0;\n19      }else{\n20          return 1;\n21      }\n22  }\n23  int lower_bound(int *a, int n, int key){\n24      int left, mid, right;\n25      left = 0, right = n;\n26      mid = (left + right)/2;\n27      while ((left+1 != mid || mid+1 != right) && mid != left){\n28          if (key > a[mid]){\n29              left = mid;\n30          }else{\n31              right = mid+1;\n32          }\n33          mid = (left + right)/2;\n34      }\n35      if (a[left] >= key)return left;\n36      if (a[mid] >= key)return mid;\n37      if (a[right] >= key)return right;\n38      return n;\n39  }\n40  unsigned long  gcd(unsigned long x, unsigned long y){\n41      if (y == 0){ \n42          return x;\n43      }else if (x > y){\n44          return gcd(y, x % y);\n45      }else{\n46          return gcd(x, y % x);\n47      }\n48  }\n49  long long factorial(int x){\n50      long long rtn = 1;\n51      int i;\n52      for (i = x; i > 1; i--){\n53          rtn = (rtn*i);\n54      }\n55      return rtn;\n56  }\n57  int main(void){\n58      int h, w;\n59      long long square[3];\n60      long long min, max;\n61      long long ans = 10000000000000;\n62      scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n63      for (int i = 1; i < h; i++){\n64          square[0] = (long long)i * w;\n65          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)*(w/2);\n66          square[2] = (long long)(h-i)*(w-w/2);\n67          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n68          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n69              if (min > square[j]){\n70                  min = square[j];\n71              }\n72              if (max < square[j]){\n73                  max = square[j];\n74              }\n75          }\n76          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n77              ans = llabs(max-min);\n78          }\n79          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)/2*w;\n80          square[2] = (long long)((h-i)-(h-i)/2)*w;\n81          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n82          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n83              if (min > square[j]){\n84                  min = (long long)square[j];\n85              }\n86              if (max < square[j]){\n87                  max = (long long)square[j];\n88              }\n89          }\n90          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n91              ans = llabs(max-min);\n92          }\n93      }\n94      for (int i = 0; i < w; i++){\n95          square[0] = (long long)i*h;\n96          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)*(h/2);\n97          square[2] = (long long)(w-i)*(h-h/2);\n98          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n99          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n100              if (min > square[j]){\n101                  min = (long long)square[j];\n102              }\n103              if (max < square[j]){\n104                  max = (long long)square[j];\n105              }\n106          }\n107          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n108              ans = llabs(max-min);\n109          }\n110          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)/2*h;\n111          square[2] = (long long)((w-i)-(w-i)/2)*h;\n112          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n113          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n114              if (min > square[j]){\n115                  min = (long long)square[j];\n116              }\n117              if (max < square[j]){\n118                  max = (long long)square[j];\n119              }\n120          }\n121          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n122              ans = llabs(max-min);\n123          }\n124      }\n125      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n126      return 0;\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(ans,91)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   int descending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n6       if (*(int*)a > *(int*)b){\n7           return -1;\n8       }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n9           return 0;\n10      }else{\n11          return 1;\n12      }\n13  }\n14  int ascending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n15      if (*(int*)a < *(int*)b){\n16          return -1;\n17      }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n18          return 0;\n19      }else{\n20          return 1;\n21      }\n22  }\n23  int lower_bound(int *a, int n, int key){\n24      int left, mid, right;\n25      left = 0, right = n;\n26      mid = (left + right)/2;\n27      while ((left+1 != mid || mid+1 != right) && mid != left){\n28          if (key > a[mid]){\n29              left = mid;\n30          }else{\n31              right = mid+1;\n32          }\n33          mid = (left + right)/2;\n34      }\n35      if (a[left] >= key)return left;\n36      if (a[mid] >= key)return mid;\n37      if (a[right] >= key)return right;\n38      return n;\n39  }\n40  unsigned long  gcd(unsigned long x, unsigned long y){\n41      if (y == 0){ \n42          return x;\n43      }else if (x > y){\n44          return gcd(y, x % y);\n45      }else{\n46          return gcd(x, y % x);\n47      }\n48  }\n49  long long factorial(int x){\n50      long long rtn = 1;\n51      int i;\n52      for (i = x; i > 1; i--){\n53          rtn = (rtn*i);\n54      }\n55      return rtn;\n56  }\n57  int main(void){\n58      int h, w;\n59      long long square[3];\n60      long long min, max;\n61      long long ans = 10000000000000;\n62      scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n63      for (int i = 1; i < h; i++){\n64          square[0] = (long long)i * w;\n65          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)*(w/2);\n66          square[2] = (long long)(h-i)*(w-w/2);\n67          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n68          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n69              if (min > square[j]){\n70                  min = square[j];\n71              }\n72              if (max < square[j]){\n73                  max = square[j];\n74              }\n75          }\n76          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n77              ans = llabs(max-min);\n78          }\n79          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)/2*w;\n80          square[2] = (long long)((h-i)-(h-i)/2)*w;\n81          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n82          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n83              if (min > square[j]){\n84                  min = (long long)square[j];\n85              }\n86              if (max < square[j]){\n87                  max = (long long)square[j];\n88              }\n89          }\n90          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n91              ans = llabs(max-min);\n92          }\n93      }\n94      for (int i = 0; i < w; i++){\n95          square[0] = (long long)i*h;\n96          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)*(h/2);\n97          square[2] = (long long)(w-i)*(h-h/2);\n98          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n99          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n100              if (min > square[j]){\n101                  min = (long long)square[j];\n102              }\n103              if (max < square[j]){\n104                  max = (long long)square[j];\n105              }\n106          }\n107          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n108              ans = llabs(max-min);\n109          }\n110          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)/2*h;\n111          square[2] = (long long)((w-i)-(w-i)/2)*h;\n112          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n113          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n114              if (min > square[j]){\n115                  min = (long long)square[j];\n116              }\n117              if (max < square[j]){\n118                  max = (long long)square[j];\n119              }\n120          }\n121          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n122              ans = llabs(max-min);\n123          }\n124      }\n125      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n126      return 0;\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(square,66)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <math.h>\n5   int descending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n6       if (*(int*)a > *(int*)b){\n7           return -1;\n8       }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n9           return 0;\n10      }else{\n11          return 1;\n12      }\n13  }\n14  int ascending_compare(const void *a, const void *b){\n15      if (*(int*)a < *(int*)b){\n16          return -1;\n17      }else if (*(int*)a == *(int*)b){\n18          return 0;\n19      }else{\n20          return 1;\n21      }\n22  }\n23  int lower_bound(int *a, int n, int key){\n24      int left, mid, right;\n25      left = 0, right = n;\n26      mid = (left + right)/2;\n27      while ((left+1 != mid || mid+1 != right) && mid != left){\n28          if (key > a[mid]){\n29              left = mid;\n30          }else{\n31              right = mid+1;\n32          }\n33          mid = (left + right)/2;\n34      }\n35      if (a[left] >= key)return left;\n36      if (a[mid] >= key)return mid;\n37      if (a[right] >= key)return right;\n38      return n;\n39  }\n40  unsigned long  gcd(unsigned long x, unsigned long y){\n41      if (y == 0){ \n42          return x;\n43      }else if (x > y){\n44          return gcd(y, x % y);\n45      }else{\n46          return gcd(x, y % x);\n47      }\n48  }\n49  long long factorial(int x){\n50      long long rtn = 1;\n51      int i;\n52      for (i = x; i > 1; i--){\n53          rtn = (rtn*i);\n54      }\n55      return rtn;\n56  }\n57  int main(void){\n58      int h, w;\n59      long long square[3];\n60      long long min, max;\n61      long long ans = 10000000000000;\n62      scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n63      for (int i = 1; i < h; i++){\n64          square[0] = (long long)i * w;\n65          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)*(w/2);\n66          square[2] = (long long)(h-i)*(w-w/2);\n67          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n68          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n69              if (min > square[j]){\n70                  min = square[j];\n71              }\n72              if (max < square[j]){\n73                  max = square[j];\n74              }\n75          }\n76          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n77              ans = llabs(max-min);\n78          }\n79          square[1] = (long long)(h-i)/2*w;\n80          square[2] = (long long)((h-i)-(h-i)/2)*w;\n81          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n82          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n83              if (min > square[j]){\n84                  min = (long long)square[j];\n85              }\n86              if (max < square[j]){\n87                  max = (long long)square[j];\n88              }\n89          }\n90          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n91              ans = llabs(max-min);\n92          }\n93      }\n94      for (int i = 0; i < w; i++){\n95          square[0] = (long long)i*h;\n96          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)*(h/2);\n97          square[2] = (long long)(w-i)*(h-h/2);\n98          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n99          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n100              if (min > square[j]){\n101                  min = (long long)square[j];\n102              }\n103              if (max < square[j]){\n104                  max = (long long)square[j];\n105              }\n106          }\n107          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n108              ans = llabs(max-min);\n109          }\n110          square[1] = (long long)(w-i)/2*h;\n111          square[2] = (long long)((w-i)-(w-i)/2)*h;\n112          min = 10000000000000, max = 0;\n113          for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){\n114              if (min > square[j]){\n115                  min = (long long)square[j];\n116              }\n117              if (max < square[j]){\n118                  max = (long long)square[j];\n119              }\n120          }\n121          if (ans > llabs(max-min)){\n122              ans = llabs(max-min);\n123          }\n124      }\n125      printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n126      return 0;\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(min,84)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #define min(a,b) ((a)>(b)?(b):(a))\n4   int popcount(int n){\n5   \tif(!n)return 0;\n6   \treturn (n&1) + popcount(n>>1);\n7   }\n8   int main(){\n9   \tint N, X[20], Y[20], P[20], a[20];\n10  \tlong Z[1<<16][16][2], ans[20]={1l<<60};\n11  \tscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n12  \tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n13  \t\tscanf(\"%d%d%d\", X+i, Y+i, P+i);\n14  \t\tans[i+1] = 1l<<60;\n15  \t}\n16  \tfor(int i=0; i<(1<<N); i++){\n17  \t\tfor(int j=0; j<N; j++){\n18  \t\t\tZ[i][j][0] = abs(X[j]);\n19  \t\t\tZ[i][j][1] = abs(Y[j]);\n20  \t\t\tfor(int k=0; k<N; k++){\n21  \t\t\t\tif((i>>k)&1){\n22  \t\t\t\t\tZ[i][j][0] = min(Z[i][j][0], (long)abs(X[j]-X[k]));\n23  \t\t\t\t\tZ[i][j][1] = min(Z[i][j][1], (long)abs(Y[j]-Y[k]));\n24  \t\t\t\t}\n25  \t\t\t}\n26  \t\t}\n27  \t}\n28  \twhile(!a[N]){\n29  \t\tint h=0, v=0;\n30  \t\tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n31  \t\t\tif(a[i]==1)\t\n32  \t\t\t\th |= (1<<i);\n33  \t\t\tif(a[i]==2)\t\n34  \t\t\t\tv |= (1<<i);\n35  \t\t}\n36  \t\tint t = popcount(h|v);\n37  \t\tlong sum = 0;\n38  \t\tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n39  \t\t\tsum += (long)P[i] * min(Z[h][i][0], Z[v][i][1]);\n40  \t\t}\n41  \t\tint i=0;\n42  \t\twhile(a[i]==2)\n43  \t\t\ta[i++]=0;\n44  \t\ta[i]++;\n45  \t\tans[t] = min(ans[t], sum);\n46  \t}\n47  \tfor(int i=0; i<=N; i++){\n48  \t\tprintf(\"%ld\\n\", ans[i]);\n49  \t}\n50  \treturn 0;\n51  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,12)` in function `main`?

In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3.

There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #define min(a,b) ((a)>(b)?(b):(a))\n4   int popcount(int n){\n5   \tif(!n)return 0;\n6   \treturn (n&1) + popcount(n>>1);\n7   }\n8   int main(){\n9   \tint N, X[20], Y[20], P[20], a[20];\n10  \tlong Z[1<<16][16][2], ans[20]={1l<<60};\n11  \tscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n12  \tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n13  \t\tscanf(\"%d%d%d\", X+i, Y+i, P+i);\n14  \t\tans[i+1] = 1l<<60;\n15  \t}\n16  \tfor(int i=0; i<(1<<N); i++){\n17  \t\tfor(int j=0; j<N; j++){\n18  \t\t\tZ[i][j][0] = abs(X[j]);\n19  \t\t\tZ[i][j][1] = abs(Y[j]);\n20  \t\t\tfor(int k=0; k<N; k++){\n21  \t\t\t\tif((i>>k)&1){\n22  \t\t\t\t\tZ[i][j][0] = min(Z[i][j][0], (long)abs(X[j]-X[k]));\n23  \t\t\t\t\tZ[i][j][1] = min(Z[i][j][1], (long)abs(Y[j]-Y[k]));\n24  \t\t\t\t}\n25  \t\t\t}\n26  \t\t}\n27  \t}\n28  \twhile(!a[N]){\n29  \t\tint h=0, v=0;\n30  \t\tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n31  \t\t\tif(a[i]==1)\t\n32  \t\t\t\th |= (1<<i);\n33  \t\t\tif(a[i]==2)\t\n34  \t\t\t\tv |= (1<<i);\n35  \t\t}\n36  \t\tint t = popcount(h|v);\n37  \t\tlong sum = 0;\n38  \t\tfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n39  \t\t\tsum += (long)P[i] * min(Z[h][i][0], Z[v][i][1]);\n40  \t\t}\n41  \t\tint i=0;\n42  \t\twhile(a[i]==2)\n43  \t\t\ta[i++]=0;\n44  \t\ta[i]++;\n45  \t\tans[t] = min(ans[t], sum);\n46  \t}\n47  \tfor(int i=0; i<=N; i++){\n48  \t\tprintf(\"%ld\\n\", ans[i]);\n49  \t}\n50  \treturn 0;\n51  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(sum,39)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #include<string.h>\n4   #include<math.h>\n5   #define sl(x) scanf(\"%ld\", &x)\n6   #define ss(x) scanf(\"%s\", x)\n7   #define pl(x) printf(\"%ld\\n\", x)\n8   #define pd(x) printf(\"%lf\\n\", x)\n9   #define ps(x) printf(\"%s\\n\", x)\n10  #define INF 1000000000000000000\n11  #define MOD 1000000007\n12  #define MIN(a,b) (((a)<(b))?(a):(b))\n13  #define MAX(a,b) (((a)>(b))?(a):(b))\n14  int compare_long(const void *a, const void *b) {\n15  \treturn *(long*)a - *(long*)b;\n16  }\n17  int main() {\n18  \tlong N, M;\n19  \tlong a[300001];\n20  \tchar s[100010];\n21  \tlong i, j;\n22  \tchar ans[100010];\n23  \tlong pre, next;\n24  \tscanf(\"%ld\", &N);\n25  \tscanf(\"%s\", s);\n26  \tfor(i=0;i<N;i++) \n27  \t\tans[i] = 'S';\n28  \tans[N] = '\\0';\n29  \tfor(i=0;i<N-1;i++) {\n30  \t\tpre = (i + N - 1) % N;\n31  \t\tnext = (i + 1) % N;\n32  \t\tif(ans[i] == 'S') {\n33  \t\t\tif(s[i] == 'o' && ans[pre] != ans[next]) {\n34  \t\t\t\tans[next] = ans[pre];\n35  \t\t\t}\n36  \t\t\tif(s[i] == 'x' && ans[pre] == ans[next]) {\n37  \t\t\t\tans[next] = ans[next] == 'S' ?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #include<string.h>\n4   #include<math.h>\n5   #define sl(x) scanf(\"%ld\", &x)\n6   #define ss(x) scanf(\"%s\", x)\n7   #define pl(x) printf(\"%ld\\n\", x)\n8   #define pd(x) printf(\"%lf\\n\", x)\n9   #define ps(x) printf(\"%s\\n\", x)\n10  #define INF 1000000000000000000\n11  #define MOD 1000000007\n12  #define MIN(a,b) (((a)<(b))?(a):(b))\n13  #define MAX(a,b) (((a)>(b))?(a):(b))\n14  int compare_long(const void *a, const void *b) {\n15  \treturn *(long*)a - *(long*)b;\n16  }\n17  int main() {\n18  \tlong N, M;\n19  \tlong a[300001];\n20  \tchar s[100010];\n21  \tlong i, j;\n22  \tchar ans[100010];\n23  \tlong pre, next;\n24  \tscanf(\"%ld\", &N);\n25  \tscanf(\"%s\", s);\n26  \tfor(i=0;i<N;i++) \n27  \t\tans[i] = 'S';\n28  \tans[N] = '\\0';\n29  \tfor(i=0;i<N-1;i++) {\n30  \t\tpre = (i + N - 1) % N;\n31  \t\tnext = (i + 1) % N;\n32  \t\tif(ans[i] == 'S') {\n33  \t\t\tif(s[i] == 'o' && ans[pre] != ans[next]) {\n34  \t\t\t\tans[next] = ans[pre];\n35  \t\t\t}\n36  \t\t\tif(s[i] == 'x' && ans[pre] == ans[next]) {\n37  \t\t\t\tans[next] = ans[next] == 'S' ?

Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   #include <stdlib.h>\n4   #define lli long long int\n5   #define BIG 1000000007\n6   void debug_c(char **dp, int h, int w)\n7   {\n8   \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n9   \tint i = 0;\n10  \tint j = 0;\n11  \twhile (i < h)\n12  \t{\n13  \t\tj = 0;\n14  \t\twhile (j < w)\n15  \t\t{\n16  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d,\",dp[i][j]);\n17  \t\t\tj++;\n18  \t\t}\n19  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n20  \t\ti++;\n21  \t}\n22  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n23  }\n24  void debug(int **dp, int h, int w)\n25  {\n26  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n27  \tint i = 0;\n28  \tint j = 0;\n29  \twhile (i < h)\n30  \t{\n31  \t\tj = 0;\n32  \t\twhile (j < w)\n33  \t\t{\n34  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d\",dp[j][i]);\n35  \t\t\tj++;\n36  \t\t}\n37  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n38  \t\ti++;\n39  \t}\n40  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n41  }\n42  int main(void)\n43  {\t\n44  \tint h, w;\n45  \tscanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n46  \tint i = 0;\n47  \tint j = 0;\n48  \tchar **a;\n49  \tint **dp;\n50  \ta = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *)*(h));\n51  \tdp = (int **)malloc(sizeof(int *)*(w));\n52  \twhile (i < w)\n53  \t{\n54  \t\tdp[i] = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*(h));\n55  \t\ti++;\n56  \t}\n57  \twhile (j < h)\n58  \t{\n59  \t\ta[j] = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*(w));\n60  \t\tj++;\n61  \t}\n62  \ti = 0;\n63  \tj = 0;\n64  \twhile (i < h)\n65  \t{\n66  \t\tj = 0;\n67  \t\tscanf(\"%s\",a[i]);\n68  \t\twhile (j < w)\n69  \t\t{\n70  \t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n71  \t\t\tif(a[i][j] == '#')\n72  \t\t\t{\n73  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = -1;\n74  \t\t\t}\n75  \t\t\tj++;\n76  \t\t}\n77  \t\ti++;\n78  \t}\n79  \tdp[0][0] = 1;\n80  \ti = 1;\n81  \tj = 1;\n82  \twhile (i < h)\n83  \t{\n84  \t\tif(dp[0][i] == -1)\n85  \t\t{\n86  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = 0;\n87  \t\t}\n88  \t\telse\n89  \t\t{\n90  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1];\n91  \t\t}\n92  \t\ti++;\n93  \t}\n94  \twhile (j < w)\n95  \t{\n96  \t\tif(dp[j][0] == -1)\n97  \t\t{\n98  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = 0;\n99  \t\t}\n100  \t\telse\n101  \t\t{\n102  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0];\n103  \t\t}\n104  \t\tj++;\n105  \t}\n106  \ti = 1;\n107  \tj = 1;\n108  \twhile (i< h)\n109  \t{\n110  \t\tj = 1;\n111  \t\twhile (j < w)\n112  \t\t{\n113  \t\t\tif(dp[j][i] == -1)\n114  \t\t\t{\n115  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n116  \t\t\t}\n117  \t\t\telse\n118  \t\t\t{\n119  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = (dp[j-1][i]+dp[j][i-1])%BIG;\n120  \t\t\t}\n121  \t\t\tj++;\n122  \t\t}\n123  \t\ti++;\n124  \t}\n125  \tprintf(\"%d\\n\",dp[w-1][h-1]);\n126  \treturn (0);\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(j,75)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   #include <stdlib.h>\n4   #define lli long long int\n5   #define BIG 1000000007\n6   void debug_c(char **dp, int h, int w)\n7   {\n8   \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n9   \tint i = 0;\n10  \tint j = 0;\n11  \twhile (i < h)\n12  \t{\n13  \t\tj = 0;\n14  \t\twhile (j < w)\n15  \t\t{\n16  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d,\",dp[i][j]);\n17  \t\t\tj++;\n18  \t\t}\n19  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n20  \t\ti++;\n21  \t}\n22  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n23  }\n24  void debug(int **dp, int h, int w)\n25  {\n26  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n27  \tint i = 0;\n28  \tint j = 0;\n29  \twhile (i < h)\n30  \t{\n31  \t\tj = 0;\n32  \t\twhile (j < w)\n33  \t\t{\n34  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d\",dp[j][i]);\n35  \t\t\tj++;\n36  \t\t}\n37  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n38  \t\ti++;\n39  \t}\n40  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n41  }\n42  int main(void)\n43  {\t\n44  \tint h, w;\n45  \tscanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n46  \tint i = 0;\n47  \tint j = 0;\n48  \tchar **a;\n49  \tint **dp;\n50  \ta = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *)*(h));\n51  \tdp = (int **)malloc(sizeof(int *)*(w));\n52  \twhile (i < w)\n53  \t{\n54  \t\tdp[i] = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*(h));\n55  \t\ti++;\n56  \t}\n57  \twhile (j < h)\n58  \t{\n59  \t\ta[j] = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*(w));\n60  \t\tj++;\n61  \t}\n62  \ti = 0;\n63  \tj = 0;\n64  \twhile (i < h)\n65  \t{\n66  \t\tj = 0;\n67  \t\tscanf(\"%s\",a[i]);\n68  \t\twhile (j < w)\n69  \t\t{\n70  \t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n71  \t\t\tif(a[i][j] == '#')\n72  \t\t\t{\n73  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = -1;\n74  \t\t\t}\n75  \t\t\tj++;\n76  \t\t}\n77  \t\ti++;\n78  \t}\n79  \tdp[0][0] = 1;\n80  \ti = 1;\n81  \tj = 1;\n82  \twhile (i < h)\n83  \t{\n84  \t\tif(dp[0][i] == -1)\n85  \t\t{\n86  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = 0;\n87  \t\t}\n88  \t\telse\n89  \t\t{\n90  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1];\n91  \t\t}\n92  \t\ti++;\n93  \t}\n94  \twhile (j < w)\n95  \t{\n96  \t\tif(dp[j][0] == -1)\n97  \t\t{\n98  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = 0;\n99  \t\t}\n100  \t\telse\n101  \t\t{\n102  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0];\n103  \t\t}\n104  \t\tj++;\n105  \t}\n106  \ti = 1;\n107  \tj = 1;\n108  \twhile (i< h)\n109  \t{\n110  \t\tj = 1;\n111  \t\twhile (j < w)\n112  \t\t{\n113  \t\t\tif(dp[j][i] == -1)\n114  \t\t\t{\n115  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n116  \t\t\t}\n117  \t\t\telse\n118  \t\t\t{\n119  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = (dp[j-1][i]+dp[j][i-1])%BIG;\n120  \t\t\t}\n121  \t\t\tj++;\n122  \t\t}\n123  \t\ti++;\n124  \t}\n125  \tprintf(\"%d\\n\",dp[w-1][h-1]);\n126  \treturn (0);\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(dp,102)` in function `main`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   #include <stdlib.h>\n4   #define lli long long int\n5   #define BIG 1000000007\n6   void debug_c(char **dp, int h, int w)\n7   {\n8   \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n9   \tint i = 0;\n10  \tint j = 0;\n11  \twhile (i < h)\n12  \t{\n13  \t\tj = 0;\n14  \t\twhile (j < w)\n15  \t\t{\n16  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d,\",dp[i][j]);\n17  \t\t\tj++;\n18  \t\t}\n19  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n20  \t\ti++;\n21  \t}\n22  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n23  }\n24  void debug(int **dp, int h, int w)\n25  {\n26  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n27  \tint i = 0;\n28  \tint j = 0;\n29  \twhile (i < h)\n30  \t{\n31  \t\tj = 0;\n32  \t\twhile (j < w)\n33  \t\t{\n34  \t\t\tprintf(\"%d\",dp[j][i]);\n35  \t\t\tj++;\n36  \t\t}\n37  \t\tprintf(\"\\n\");\n38  \t\ti++;\n39  \t}\n40  \tprintf(\"----debug\\n\");\n41  }\n42  int main(void)\n43  {\t\n44  \tint h, w;\n45  \tscanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &w);\n46  \tint i = 0;\n47  \tint j = 0;\n48  \tchar **a;\n49  \tint **dp;\n50  \ta = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *)*(h));\n51  \tdp = (int **)malloc(sizeof(int *)*(w));\n52  \twhile (i < w)\n53  \t{\n54  \t\tdp[i] = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*(h));\n55  \t\ti++;\n56  \t}\n57  \twhile (j < h)\n58  \t{\n59  \t\ta[j] = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*(w));\n60  \t\tj++;\n61  \t}\n62  \ti = 0;\n63  \tj = 0;\n64  \twhile (i < h)\n65  \t{\n66  \t\tj = 0;\n67  \t\tscanf(\"%s\",a[i]);\n68  \t\twhile (j < w)\n69  \t\t{\n70  \t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n71  \t\t\tif(a[i][j] == '#')\n72  \t\t\t{\n73  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = -1;\n74  \t\t\t}\n75  \t\t\tj++;\n76  \t\t}\n77  \t\ti++;\n78  \t}\n79  \tdp[0][0] = 1;\n80  \ti = 1;\n81  \tj = 1;\n82  \twhile (i < h)\n83  \t{\n84  \t\tif(dp[0][i] == -1)\n85  \t\t{\n86  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = 0;\n87  \t\t}\n88  \t\telse\n89  \t\t{\n90  \t\t\tdp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1];\n91  \t\t}\n92  \t\ti++;\n93  \t}\n94  \twhile (j < w)\n95  \t{\n96  \t\tif(dp[j][0] == -1)\n97  \t\t{\n98  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = 0;\n99  \t\t}\n100  \t\telse\n101  \t\t{\n102  \t\t\tdp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0];\n103  \t\t}\n104  \t\tj++;\n105  \t}\n106  \ti = 1;\n107  \tj = 1;\n108  \twhile (i< h)\n109  \t{\n110  \t\tj = 1;\n111  \t\twhile (j < w)\n112  \t\t{\n113  \t\t\tif(dp[j][i] == -1)\n114  \t\t\t{\n115  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = 0;\n116  \t\t\t}\n117  \t\t\telse\n118  \t\t\t{\n119  \t\t\t\tdp[j][i] = (dp[j-1][i]+dp[j][i-1])%BIG;\n120  \t\t\t}\n121  \t\t\tj++;\n122  \t\t}\n123  \t\ti++;\n124  \t}\n125  \tprintf(\"%d\\n\",dp[w-1][h-1]);\n126  \treturn (0);\n127  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(dp,86)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<math.h>\n3   int min(int a, int b)\n4   {\n5       if (a < b)\n6           return a;\n7       else\n8           return b;\n9   }\n10  int main()\n11  {\n12      int n, m;\n13      scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n14      int a[1003], b[1003];\n15      int i;\n16      for (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n17          scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n18      for (i = 0; i < m; i++)\n19          scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n20      int x;\n21      for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)\n22          if (a[i] <= a[i + 1])\n23          {\n24              if (a[i] == a[i + 1])\n25              {\n26                  printf(\"0\\n\");\n27                  return 0;\n28              }\n29              x = a[i];\n30              a[i] = a[i + 1];\n31              a[i + 1] = x;\n32              if (i > 0)\n33                  i -= 2;\n34          }\n35      for(i=0;i<m-1;i++)\n36          if (b[i] <= b[i + 1])\n37          {\n38              if (b[i] == b[i + 1])\n39              {\n40                  printf(\"0\\n\");\n41                  return 0;\n42              }\n43              x = b[i];\n44              b[i] = b[i + 1];\n45              b[i + 1] = x;\n46              if (i > 0)\n47                  i -= 2;\n48          }\n49      int p = 1000000007;\n50      double ans = 1;\n51      int k = 0;\n52      int y;\n53      int j;\n54      int q;\n55      for (i = n * m; i >= min(a[n - 1], b[m - 1]); i--)\n56      {\n57          x = y = q = 0;\n58          j = 0;\n59          while (a[j] > i)\n60          {\n61              j++;\n62              x++;\n63          }\n64          if (a[j] == i)\n65          {\n66              x = 1;\n67              q++;\n68          }\n69          j = 0;\n70          while (b[j] > i)\n71          {\n72              y++;\n73              j++;\n74          }\n75          if (b[j] == i)\n76          {\n77              y = 1;\n78              q++;\n79          }\n80          if (q==0)\n81              ans *= x * y - k;\n82          else\n83              ans *= x * y;\n84          ans = round(fmod(ans, p));\n85          k++;\n86      }\n87      for (j = 0; j < i; j++)\n88      {\n89          ans *= j + 1;\n90          ans = round(fmod(ans, p));\n91      }\n92      printf(\"%.0lf\\n\", round(ans));\n93      return 0;\n94  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,55)` in function `main`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<math.h>\n3   int min(int a, int b)\n4   {\n5       if (a < b)\n6           return a;\n7       else\n8           return b;\n9   }\n10  int main()\n11  {\n12      int n, m;\n13      scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n14      int a[1003], b[1003];\n15      int i;\n16      for (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n17          scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n18      for (i = 0; i < m; i++)\n19          scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n20      int x;\n21      for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)\n22          if (a[i] <= a[i + 1])\n23          {\n24              if (a[i] == a[i + 1])\n25              {\n26                  printf(\"0\\n\");\n27                  return 0;\n28              }\n29              x = a[i];\n30              a[i] = a[i + 1];\n31              a[i + 1] = x;\n32              if (i > 0)\n33                  i -= 2;\n34          }\n35      for(i=0;i<m-1;i++)\n36          if (b[i] <= b[i + 1])\n37          {\n38              if (b[i] == b[i + 1])\n39              {\n40                  printf(\"0\\n\");\n41                  return 0;\n42              }\n43              x = b[i];\n44              b[i] = b[i + 1];\n45              b[i + 1] = x;\n46              if (i > 0)\n47                  i -= 2;\n48          }\n49      int p = 1000000007;\n50      double ans = 1;\n51      int k = 0;\n52      int y;\n53      int j;\n54      int q;\n55      for (i = n * m; i >= min(a[n - 1], b[m - 1]); i--)\n56      {\n57          x = y = q = 0;\n58          j = 0;\n59          while (a[j] > i)\n60          {\n61              j++;\n62              x++;\n63          }\n64          if (a[j] == i)\n65          {\n66              x = 1;\n67              q++;\n68          }\n69          j = 0;\n70          while (b[j] > i)\n71          {\n72              y++;\n73              j++;\n74          }\n75          if (b[j] == i)\n76          {\n77              y = 1;\n78              q++;\n79          }\n80          if (q==0)\n81              ans *= x * y - k;\n82          else\n83              ans *= x * y;\n84          ans = round(fmod(ans, p));\n85          k++;\n86      }\n87      for (j = 0; j < i; j++)\n88      {\n89          ans *= j + 1;\n90          ans = round(fmod(ans, p));\n91      }\n92      printf(\"%.0lf\\n\", round(ans));\n93      return 0;\n94  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(ans,81)` in function `main`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #define NDEBUG\n3   #include <assert.h>\n4   #include <stdlib.h>\n5   #include <string.h>\n6   #include <math.h>\n7   #ifdef NDEBUG\n8   #define DEBUG_PRINT(fmt, ...)

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   int sum(int a,int b);\n3   int sub(int a,int b);\n4   int main(void){\n5   \tint i,n,a,b,c,d,x,op1,op2,op3,cnt=0;\n6   \tchar op[2]={'+','-'};\n7   \tscanf(\"%d\",&n);\n8   \ta=(n/1000)%10;\n9   \tb=(n/100)%10;\n10  \tc=(n/10)%10;\n11  \td=n%10;\n12  \tfor(;;){\n13  \t\tx=0;\n14  \t\top1=0;\n15  \t\top2=0;\n16  \t\top3=0;\n17  \t\tfor(i=0;i<3;i++){\n18  \t\t\tif((cnt<3)||(cnt==4)){\n19  \t\t\t\tx=sum(a,b);\n20  \t\t\t\tif(cnt<2){\n21  \t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,c);\n22  \t\t\t\t\tif(cnt==0){\n23  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,d);\n24  \t\t\t\t\t}else{\n25  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,d);\n26  \t\t\t\t\t\top3=1;\n27  \t\t\t\t\t}\n28  \t\t\t\t}else{\n29  \t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,c);\n30  \t\t\t\t\top2=1;\n31  \t\t\t\t\tif(cnt==2){\n32  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,d);\n33  \t\t\t\t\t}else{\n34  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,d);\n35  \t\t\t\t\t\top3=1;\n36  \t\t\t\t\t}\n37  \t\t\t\t}\n38  \t\t\t}else{\n39  \t\t\t\tx=sub(a,b);\n40  \t\t\t\top1=1;\n41  \t\t\t\tif((cnt==3)||(cnt==6)){\n42  \t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,c);\n43  \t\t\t\t\tif(cnt==3){\n44  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,d);\n45  \t\t\t\t\t}else{\n46  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,d);\n47  \t\t\t\t\t\top3=1;\n48  \t\t\t\t\t}\n49  \t\t\t\t}else{\n50  \t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,c);\n51  \t\t\t\t\top2=1;\n52  \t\t\t\t\tif(cnt==5){\n53  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sum(x,d);\n54  \t\t\t\t\t}else{\n55  \t\t\t\t\t\tx=sub(x,d);\n56  \t\t\t\t\t\top3=1;\n57  \t\t\t\t\t}\n58  \t\t\t\t}\n59  \t\t\t}\n60  \t\t}\n61  \t\tif(x==7){\n62  \t\t\tbreak;\n63  \t\t}\n64  \t\tcnt++;\n65  \t}\n66  \tprintf(\"%d%c%d%c%d%c%d=7\",a,op[op1],b,op[op2],c,op[op3],d);\n67  \treturn 0;\n68  }\n69  int sum(int a,int b){\n70  \treturn a+b;\n71  }\n72  int sub(int a,int b){\n73  \treturn a-b;\n74  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(x,29)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #define inf 2e30+1\n3   typedef long long ll;\n4   int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n5     return *(int*)a - *(int*)b;\n6   }\n7   int main(void) {\n8     int i, j, k, n, m;\n9     scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &m);\n10    int x, y, uni[n], a[n];\n11    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n12      scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n13    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n14      uni[i] = i;\n15    for(i = 0; i < m; ++i) {\n16      scanf(\"%d%d\", &x, &y);\n17      int t;\n18      if(uni[x] != x) {\n19        t = uni[y];\n20        uni[y] = x;\n21        for(j = y; uni[j] != j; ) {\n22          j = uni[j];\n23        }\n24        uni[y] = j;\n25        for(j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n26          if(j == y) \n27            continue;\n28          if(uni[j] == t) \n29            uni[j] = uni[y];\n30        }\n31      } else {\n32        t = uni[x];\n33        uni[x] = y;\n34        for(j = x; uni[j] != j; ) {\n35          j = uni[j];\n36        }\n37        uni[x] = j;\n38        for(j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n39          if(j == x) \n40            continue;\n41          if(uni[j] == t) \n42            uni[j] = uni[x];\n43        }\n44      }\n45    }\n46    int num = 0;\n47    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n48      if(uni[i] == i) \n49        ++num;\n50    }\n51    if(num == 1) {\n52      printf(\"0\");\n53      return 0;\n54    }\n55    if(num * 2 - 2 > n) {\n56      printf(\"Impossible\");\n57      return 0;\n58    }\n59    if(num * 2 - 2 == n) {\n60      int t = 0;\n61      for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n62        t += a[i];\n63      printf(\"%d\", t);\n64      return 0;\n65    }\n66    int min[n], minn[n];\n67    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n68      min[i] = inf;\n69    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n70      if(min[uni[i]] > a[i]) {\n71        minn[uni[i]] = i;\n72        min[uni[i]] = a[i];\n73      }\n74    ll ssum = 0;\n75    int tnum = num - 2;\n76    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n77      int y = inf;\n78      if(min[i] != y) {\n79        ssum += (ll)min[i];\n80        a[minn[i]] = inf;\n81      }\n82    }\n83    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n84    for(i = 0; i < tnum; ++i) {\n85      ssum += a[i];\n86    }\n87    printf(\"%lld\", ssum);\n88    return 0;\n89  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(min,68)` in function `main`?

Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #define inf 2e30+1\n3   typedef long long ll;\n4   int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n5     return *(int*)a - *(int*)b;\n6   }\n7   int main(void) {\n8     int i, j, k, n, m;\n9     scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &m);\n10    int x, y, uni[n], a[n];\n11    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n12      scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n13    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n14      uni[i] = i;\n15    for(i = 0; i < m; ++i) {\n16      scanf(\"%d%d\", &x, &y);\n17      int t;\n18      if(uni[x] != x) {\n19        t = uni[y];\n20        uni[y] = x;\n21        for(j = y; uni[j] != j; ) {\n22          j = uni[j];\n23        }\n24        uni[y] = j;\n25        for(j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n26          if(j == y) \n27            continue;\n28          if(uni[j] == t) \n29            uni[j] = uni[y];\n30        }\n31      } else {\n32        t = uni[x];\n33        uni[x] = y;\n34        for(j = x; uni[j] != j; ) {\n35          j = uni[j];\n36        }\n37        uni[x] = j;\n38        for(j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n39          if(j == x) \n40            continue;\n41          if(uni[j] == t) \n42            uni[j] = uni[x];\n43        }\n44      }\n45    }\n46    int num = 0;\n47    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n48      if(uni[i] == i) \n49        ++num;\n50    }\n51    if(num == 1) {\n52      printf(\"0\");\n53      return 0;\n54    }\n55    if(num * 2 - 2 > n) {\n56      printf(\"Impossible\");\n57      return 0;\n58    }\n59    if(num * 2 - 2 == n) {\n60      int t = 0;\n61      for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n62        t += a[i];\n63      printf(\"%d\", t);\n64      return 0;\n65    }\n66    int min[n], minn[n];\n67    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n68      min[i] = inf;\n69    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) \n70      if(min[uni[i]] > a[i]) {\n71        minn[uni[i]] = i;\n72        min[uni[i]] = a[i];\n73      }\n74    ll ssum = 0;\n75    int tnum = num - 2;\n76    for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n77      int y = inf;\n78      if(min[i] != y) {\n79        ssum += (ll)min[i];\n80        a[minn[i]] = inf;\n81      }\n82    }\n83    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n84    for(i = 0; i < tnum; ++i) {\n85      ssum += a[i];\n86    }\n87    printf(\"%lld\", ssum);\n88    return 0;\n89  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(a,12)` in function `main`?

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include \"stdio.h\"\n2   #include \"stdlib.h\"\n3   #include \"ctype.h\"\n4   #include \"string.h\"\n5   void solve();\n6   int getInt();\n7   float getFloat();\n8   char* getWord();\n9   int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n10      solve();\n11      return 0;\n12  }\n13  void solve() {\n14      const int numCases = getInt();\n15      const int maxNights = getInt();\n16      const int maxGophers = getInt();\n17      for(int c = 1; c <= numCases; c++) {\n18          int answer = 1;\n19          for(int night = 1; night <= maxNights; night++) {\n20              const int numBlades = night + 1;\n21              if(numBlades > 18) {\n22                  break;\n23              }\n24              for(int hole = 0; hole < 18; hole++) {\n25                  printf(\"%i \", numBlades);\n26              }\n27              printf(\"\\n\");\n28              int sum = 0;\n29              for(int hole = 0; hole < 18; hole++) {\n30                  sum += getInt();\n31              }\n32              if((sum % numBlades) == 0) {\n33                  answer *= numBlades;\n34              }\n35          }\n36          printf(\"%i\\n\", answer);\n37          const int correct = getInt();\n38          if(correct == -1) {\n39              return;\n40          }\n41      }\n42  }\n43  int getInt() {\n44      int result;\n45      scanf(\"%i\", &result);\n46      return result;\n47  }\n48  float getFloat() {\n49      float result;\n50      scanf(\"%f\", &result);\n51      return result;\n52  }\n53  char* getWord() {\n54      int size = 1;\n55      char* word = malloc(size * sizeof(char));\n56      char c;\n57      int i = 0;\n58      while(isspace(c = getchar()));\n59      ungetc(c, stdin);\n60      while(!isspace(c = getchar())) {\n61          if(i + 1 >= size) {\n62              size *= 2;\n63              word = realloc(word, size * sizeof(char));\n64          }\n65          word[i] = c;\n66          i++;\n67      }\n68      word[i] = '\\0';\n69      return word;\n70  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(answer,33)` in function `solve`?

List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <limits.h>\n5   #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ?

There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #define MAXS 10005\n4   long int getmax(long int a, long int b);\n5   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n6   \tint ntests;\n7   \tscanf(\"%d\", &ntests);\n8   \tint test;\n9   \tlong int D[MAXS];\n10  \tlong int A[MAXS];\n11  \tlong int B[MAXS];\n12  \tlong int M[MAXS], N[MAXS];\n13  \tint longm[MAXS], longn[MAXS];\n14  \tint s;\n15  \tint i;\n16  \tint j;\n17  \tint max;\n18  \tint max_no;\n19  \tfor (test=1; test<=ntests; test++) {\n20  \t\tscanf(\"%d\", &s);\n21  \t\tfor (i=0; i<s; i++) {\n22  \t\t\tscanf(\"%li %li %li\", D+i, A+i, B+i);\n23  \t\t\tM[i] = D[i]+A[i];\n24  \t\t\tN[i] = D[i] - B[i];\n25  \t\t}\n26  \t\tlongm[0] = 1;\n27  \t\tlongn[0] = 1;\n28  \t\tfor (i=1; i<s; i++) {\n29  \t\t\tif (M[i] ==M[i-1]) {\n30  \t\t\t\tlongm[i] = longm[i-1] + 1;\n31  \t\t\t}\n32  \t\t\telse {\n33  \t\t\t\tlongm[i] = 2;\n34  \t\t\t\tj=i-2;\n35  \t\t\t\twhile (j>=0 && (M[j]==M[i] || N[j]==N[i-1])) {\n36  \t\t\t\t\tlongm[i]++;\n37  \t\t\t\t\tj--;\n38  \t\t\t\t}\n39  \t\t\t}\n40  \t\t\tif (N[i] ==N[i-1]) {\n41  \t\t\t\tlongn[i] = longn[i-1] + 1;\n42  \t\t\t}\n43  \t\t\telse {\n44  \t\t\t\tlongn[i] = 2;\n45  \t\t\t\tj=i-2;\n46  \t\t\t\twhile (j>=0 && (N[j]==N[i] || M[j]==M[i-1])) {\n47  \t\t\t\t\tlongn[i]++;\n48  \t\t\t\t\tj--;\n49  \t\t\t\t}\n50  \t\t\t}\n51  \t\t}\n52  \t\tmax = getmax(longm[0], longn[0]);\n53  \t\tmax_no = 1;\n54  \t\tfor (i=1; i<s; i++) {\n55  \t\t\tif (getmax(longm[i], longn[i]) > max) {\n56  \t\t\t\tmax_no = 1;\n57  \t\t\t\tmax = getmax(longm[i], longn[i]);\n58  \t\t\t}\n59  \t\t\telse if (getmax(longm[i], longn[i]) == max) {\n60  \t\t\t\tmax_no++;\n61  \t\t\t}\n62  \t\t}\n63  \t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: %d %d\\n\", test, max, max_no);\n64  \t}\n65  \treturn 0;\n66  }\n67  long int getmax(long int a, long int b) {\n68  \tif (a>b) {\n69  \t\treturn a;\n70  \t}\n71  \treturn b;\n72  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(longn,41)` in function `main`?

Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   int A[1005];\n3   int ori[1005];\n4   char res[1005][1005];\n5   int cnt[1005][1005];\n6   int max(int a, int b){ return a > b ? a : b; }\n7   int main(){\n8       int T;\n9       scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n10      for(int tc=0; tc<T; tc++){\n11          int C;\n12          scanf(\"%d\", &C);\n13          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) {\n14              scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n15              ori[i] = A[i];\n16          }\n17          int mx = 0;\n18          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n19              mx = max(mx, A[i]);\n20          printf(\"Case #%d: \", tc+1);\n21          if(A[1] == 0 || A[C] == 0){\n22              printf(\"IMPOSSIBLE\\n\");\n23              continue;\n24          }\n25          int R = 0;\n26          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n27              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++) \n28                  res[i][j] = '.';\n29          int cur = 0;\n30          int cons = 0;\n31          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++){\n32              if(cur >= 1){\n33                  int fi = 0;\n34                  for(int j=1; j<C; j++) \n35                      if(A[j]){\n36                          fi = j;\n37                          break;\n38                      }\n39                  for(int j=i; j>fi; j--){\n40                      res[i-j+1][j] = '/';\n41                      R = max(R, i-j+1);\n42                  }\n43                  A[fi]--;\n44                  cur--;\n45                  cur += A[i];\n46                  cons = 0;\n47              } else{\n48                  cur += A[i];\n49                  if(cur >= 1){\n50                      cur--;\n51                      A[i] = cur;\n52                      cons = 0;\n53                  } else{\n54                      cons++;\n55                      for(int j=1; j<=-cur+1; j++) \n56                          res[j][i] = '\\\\';\n57                      R = max(R, -cur+1);\n58                      cur--;\n59                  }\n60              }\n61          }\n62          for(int i=1; i<=R+1; i++) \n63              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++)\n64                  cnt[i][j] = 0;\n65          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n66              cnt[1][i] = 1;\n67          for(int i=1; i<=R; i++){\n68              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++){\n69                  if(res[i][j] == '.') \n70                      cnt[i+1][j] += cnt[i][j];\n71                  else if(res[i][j] == '\\\\') \n72                      cnt[i+1][j+1] += cnt[i][j];\n73                  else if(res[i][j] == '/') \n74                      cnt[i+1][j-1] += cnt[i][j];\n75              }\n76          }\n77          int valid = 1;\n78          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++){\n79              if(res[R+1][i] != ori[i]){\n80                  valid = 0;\n81              }\n82          }\n83          if(!valid){\n84              printf(\"IMPOSSIBLE\\n\");\n85              continue;\n86          }\n87          printf(\"%d\\n\", R+1);\n88          for(int i=1; i<=R; i++){\n89              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++) \n90                  printf(\"%c\", res[i][j]);\n91              printf(\"\\n\");\n92          }\n93          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n94              printf(\".\");\n95          printf(\"\\n\");\n96      }\n97      return 0;\n98  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(A,51)` in function `main`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   int A[1005];\n3   int ori[1005];\n4   char res[1005][1005];\n5   int cnt[1005][1005];\n6   int max(int a, int b){ return a > b ? a : b; }\n7   int main(){\n8       int T;\n9       scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n10      for(int tc=0; tc<T; tc++){\n11          int C;\n12          scanf(\"%d\", &C);\n13          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) {\n14              scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n15              ori[i] = A[i];\n16          }\n17          int mx = 0;\n18          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n19              mx = max(mx, A[i]);\n20          printf(\"Case #%d: \", tc+1);\n21          if(A[1] == 0 || A[C] == 0){\n22              printf(\"IMPOSSIBLE\\n\");\n23              continue;\n24          }\n25          int R = 0;\n26          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n27              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++) \n28                  res[i][j] = '.';\n29          int cur = 0;\n30          int cons = 0;\n31          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++){\n32              if(cur >= 1){\n33                  int fi = 0;\n34                  for(int j=1; j<C; j++) \n35                      if(A[j]){\n36                          fi = j;\n37                          break;\n38                      }\n39                  for(int j=i; j>fi; j--){\n40                      res[i-j+1][j] = '/';\n41                      R = max(R, i-j+1);\n42                  }\n43                  A[fi]--;\n44                  cur--;\n45                  cur += A[i];\n46                  cons = 0;\n47              } else{\n48                  cur += A[i];\n49                  if(cur >= 1){\n50                      cur--;\n51                      A[i] = cur;\n52                      cons = 0;\n53                  } else{\n54                      cons++;\n55                      for(int j=1; j<=-cur+1; j++) \n56                          res[j][i] = '\\\\';\n57                      R = max(R, -cur+1);\n58                      cur--;\n59                  }\n60              }\n61          }\n62          for(int i=1; i<=R+1; i++) \n63              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++)\n64                  cnt[i][j] = 0;\n65          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n66              cnt[1][i] = 1;\n67          for(int i=1; i<=R; i++){\n68              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++){\n69                  if(res[i][j] == '.') \n70                      cnt[i+1][j] += cnt[i][j];\n71                  else if(res[i][j] == '\\\\') \n72                      cnt[i+1][j+1] += cnt[i][j];\n73                  else if(res[i][j] == '/') \n74                      cnt[i+1][j-1] += cnt[i][j];\n75              }\n76          }\n77          int valid = 1;\n78          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++){\n79              if(res[R+1][i] != ori[i]){\n80                  valid = 0;\n81              }\n82          }\n83          if(!valid){\n84              printf(\"IMPOSSIBLE\\n\");\n85              continue;\n86          }\n87          printf(\"%d\\n\", R+1);\n88          for(int i=1; i<=R; i++){\n89              for(int j=1; j<=C; j++) \n90                  printf(\"%c\", res[i][j]);\n91              printf(\"\\n\");\n92          }\n93          for(int i=1; i<=C; i++) \n94              printf(\".\");\n95          printf(\"\\n\");\n96      }\n97      return 0;\n98  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(cur,45)` in function `main`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <math.h>\n3   int N;\n4   typedef struct _mole {\n5   \tint c;\n6   \tint j;\n7   }Mole;\n8   Mole arr[305];\n9   int Abs(int a) {\n10  \tif (a < 0)\n11  \t\treturn -1 * a;\n12  \telse\n13  \t\treturn a;\n14  }\n15  int gcd(int a, int b) {\n16  \tif (b == 0)\n17  \t\treturn a;\n18  \telse\n19  \t\treturn gcd(b, a%b);\n20  }\n21  int main(void) {\n22  \tint t, T;\n23  \tint i;\n24  \tint j;\n25  \tint ans;\n26  \tint flag;\n27  \tdouble max = -1;\n28  \tint ans_c, ans_j;\n29  \tint flag_big;\n30  \tscanf(\"%d\", &T);\n31  \tfor (t = 1; t <= T; t++) {\n32  \t\tans = 1;\n33  \t\tscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n34  \t\tfor (i = 1; i <= N; i++)\n35  \t\t\tscanf(\"%d%d\", &arr[i].c, &arr[i].j);\n36  \t\tflag = 0;\n37  \t\tflag_big = -1;\n38  \t\tfor (i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n39  \t\t\tj = i + 1;\n40  \t\t\tif ((arr[i].c <= arr[j].c && arr[i].j <= arr[j].j))\n41  \t\t\t\tcontinue;\n42  \t\t\tif (arr[i].c >= arr[j].c && arr[i].j >= arr[j].j) {\n43  \t\t\t\tflag = 1;\n44  \t\t\t\tbreak;\n45  \t\t\t}\n46  \t\t\tdouble a = arr[j].c - arr[i].c;\n47  \t\t\tdouble b = arr[i].j - arr[j].j; \n48  \t\t\tif (flag_big == -1) {\n49  \t\t\t\tif (a > 0)\n50  \t\t\t\t\tflag_big = 1;\n51  \t\t\t\telse\n52  \t\t\t\t\tflag_big = 0;\n53  \t\t\t}\n54  \t\t\tif (flag_big == 1) {\n55  \t\t\t\tif (a < 0) {\n56  \t\t\t\t\tflag = 1;\n57  \t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n58  \t\t\t\t}\n59  \t\t\t\tif (max < b / a) {\n60  \t\t\t\t\tmax = b / a;\n61  \t\t\t\t}\n62  \t\t\t}\n63  \t\t\telse {\n64  \t\t\t\tif (a > 0) {\n65  \t\t\t\t\tflag = 1;\n66  \t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n67  \t\t\t\t}\n68  \t\t\t\tif (max < b / a) {\n69  \t\t\t\t\tmax = b / a;\n70  \t\t\t\t}\n71  \t\t\t}\n72  \t\t}\n73  \t\tif(flag)\n74  \t\t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: IMPOSSIBLE\\n\", t);\n75  \t\telse {\n76  \t\t\tif (flag_big == -1) {\n77  \t\t\t\tans_c = 1;\n78  \t\t\t\tans_j = 1;\n79  \t\t\t}\n80  \t\t\telse if (flag_big == 1) {\n81  \t\t\t\tans_j = 1;\n82  \t\t\t\tans_c = floor(max+1);\n83  \t\t\t}\n84  \t\t\telse {\n85  \t\t\t\tans_c = 1;\n86  \t\t\t\tans_j = floor(max + 1);\n87  \t\t\t}\n88  \t\t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: %d %d\\n\", t, ans_c, ans_j);\n89  \t\t}\n90  \t}\n91  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(max,69)` in function `main`?

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <math.h>\n3   int Ans(long long int x)\n4   {\n5       long long int n,i,j,sum=0,r,c,k;\n6       scanf(\"%lld\",&n);\n7       long long int Mat[n][n],count[n];\n8       for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n9       {\n10          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n11              scanf(\"%lld\",&Mat[i][j]);\n12      }\n13      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n14      {\n15          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n16          {\n17              if(i==j)\n18              {\n19                  sum=sum+Mat[i][j];\n20              }\n21          }\n22      }\n23      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n24      {\n25          count[i]=0;\n26          for(j=0; j<n; j++)\n27          {\n28              for(k=j+1; k<n; k++)\n29              {\n30                  if(Mat[i][j] == Mat[i][k])\n31                  {\n32                  \tif(count[i]==0)\n33                  \t\tcount[i]=count[i]+2;\n34                  \telse\n35                      \tcount[i]++;\n36                      break;\n37                  }\n38              }\n39          }\n40      }\n41      long long int rmax=count[0];\n42      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n43      {\n44          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n45          {\n46              if(count[j]>=count[j+1])\n47              {\n48                  rmax=count[j];\n49              }\n50          }\n51      }\n52      long long int ccount[n];\n53      for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n54      {\n55          ccount[j]=0;\n56          for(i=0; i<n; i++)\n57          {\n58              for(k=i+1; k<n; k++)\n59              {\n60                  if(Mat[i][j] == Mat[k][j] )\n61                  {\n62                  \tif(ccount[j]==0)\n63                  \t\tccount[j]=ccount[j]+2;\n64                  \telse\n65                      \tccount[j]++;\n66                      break;\n67                  }\n68              }\n69          }\n70      }\n71      long long int cmax=ccount[0];\n72      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n73      {\n74          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n75          {\n76              if(ccount[j]>=ccount[j+1])\n77              {\n78                  cmax=ccount[j];\n79              }\n80          }\n81      }\n82      printf(\"Case #%lld: %lld %lld %lld\\n\",x+1,sum,rmax,cmax);\n83      return 0;\n84  }\n85  int main()\n86  {\n87      long long int i,T;\n88      scanf(\"%lld\",&T);\n89      for(i=0;i<T;i++)\n90          Ans(i);\n91      return 0;\n92  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(i,56)` in function `Ans`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <math.h>\n3   int Ans(long long int x)\n4   {\n5       long long int n,i,j,sum=0,r,c,k;\n6       scanf(\"%lld\",&n);\n7       long long int Mat[n][n],count[n];\n8       for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n9       {\n10          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n11              scanf(\"%lld\",&Mat[i][j]);\n12      }\n13      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n14      {\n15          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n16          {\n17              if(i==j)\n18              {\n19                  sum=sum+Mat[i][j];\n20              }\n21          }\n22      }\n23      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n24      {\n25          count[i]=0;\n26          for(j=0; j<n; j++)\n27          {\n28              for(k=j+1; k<n; k++)\n29              {\n30                  if(Mat[i][j] == Mat[i][k])\n31                  {\n32                  \tif(count[i]==0)\n33                  \t\tcount[i]=count[i]+2;\n34                  \telse\n35                      \tcount[i]++;\n36                      break;\n37                  }\n38              }\n39          }\n40      }\n41      long long int rmax=count[0];\n42      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n43      {\n44          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n45          {\n46              if(count[j]>=count[j+1])\n47              {\n48                  rmax=count[j];\n49              }\n50          }\n51      }\n52      long long int ccount[n];\n53      for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n54      {\n55          ccount[j]=0;\n56          for(i=0; i<n; i++)\n57          {\n58              for(k=i+1; k<n; k++)\n59              {\n60                  if(Mat[i][j] == Mat[k][j] )\n61                  {\n62                  \tif(ccount[j]==0)\n63                  \t\tccount[j]=ccount[j]+2;\n64                  \telse\n65                      \tccount[j]++;\n66                      break;\n67                  }\n68              }\n69          }\n70      }\n71      long long int cmax=ccount[0];\n72      for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n73      {\n74          for(j=0;j<n;j++)\n75          {\n76              if(ccount[j]>=ccount[j+1])\n77              {\n78                  cmax=ccount[j];\n79              }\n80          }\n81      }\n82      printf(\"Case #%lld: %lld %lld %lld\\n\",x+1,sum,rmax,cmax);\n83      return 0;\n84  }\n85  int main()\n86  {\n87      long long int i,T;\n88      scanf(\"%lld\",&T);\n89      for(i=0;i<T;i++)\n90          Ans(i);\n91      return 0;\n92  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(cmax,78)` in function `Ans`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   char temp[22][22];\n3   int compt(int y, int x)\n4   {\n5   \tif (temp[y][x])\n6   \t{\n7   \t\ttemp[y][x] = 0;\n8   \t\treturn 1 + compt(y-1, x) + compt(y+1, x)\n9   \t\t         + compt(y, x-1) + compt(y, x+1);\n10  \t}\n11  \telse return 0;\n12  }\n13  int main(int argc, char **argv)\n14  {\n15  \tunsigned long int no_cases, case_no;\n16  \tscanf(\"%lu\", &no_cases);\n17  \tfor (case_no = 0; case_no != no_cases; case_no++)\n18  \t{\n19  \t\tint r, c, x, y, s;\n20  \t\tint best = 0;\n21  \t\tchar grid[20][20];\n22  \t\tchar extras[6] = {};\n23  \t\tchar quads[16] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1};\n24  \t\tscanf(\"%i%i\", &r, &c);\n25  \t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n26  \t\t{\n27  \t\t\twhile (getchar() != '\\n') \n28  \t\t\t\t{;} \n29  \t\t\tint last = 2, this;\n30  \t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n31  \t\t\t{\n32  \t\t\t\tgrid[y][x] = this = getchar() == 'W';\n33  \t\t\t\textras[last << 1 | this] = 1;\n34  \t\t\t\tlast = this;\n35  \t\t\t}\n36  \t\t\ttemp[y][0] = temp[y][c+1] = 0;\n37  \t\t}\n38  \t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++) \n39  \t\t\ttemp[0][x] = temp[r+1][x] = 0;\n40  \t\tquads[10] |= extras[2];\n41  \t\tquads[5] |= extras[1];\n42  \t\tfor (y = 1; y != r; y++)\n43  \t\t\tfor (x = 1; x != r; x++)\n44  \t\t\t\tquads[grid[y-1][x-1] << 3 | grid[y-1][x] << 2 | grid[y][x-1] << 1 | grid[y][x]] = 1;\n45  \t\tfor (y = 1; y != r; y++)\n46  \t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != r; x++)\n47  \t\t\t{\n48  \t\t\t\tint j = grid[y-1][x] << 2 | grid[y][x];\n49  \t\t\t\tquads[j << 1 | j] = 1;\n50  \t\t\t}\n51  \t\tfor (int q = 0; q != 16; q++)\n52  \t\t\tif (quads[q])\n53  \t\t\t\tfor (int ydiv = 0; ydiv <= r; ydiv++)\n54  \t\t\t\t\tfor (int xdiv = 0; xdiv <= c; xdiv++)\n55  \t\t\t\t\t{\n56  \t\t\t\t\t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n57  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n58  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n59  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttemp[y+1][x+1] = grid[y][x] == (q >> ((y < ydiv) << 1 | (x < xdiv)) & 1);\n60  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n61  \t\t\t\t\t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n62  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n63  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n64  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ts = compt(y + 1, x + 1);\n65  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (s > best) \n66  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbest = s;\n67  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n68  \t\t\t\t\t}\n69  \t\tprintf(\"Case #%lu: %i\\n\", case_no + 1, best);\n70  \t}\n71  \treturn 0;\n72  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(y,45)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   char temp[22][22];\n3   int compt(int y, int x)\n4   {\n5   \tif (temp[y][x])\n6   \t{\n7   \t\ttemp[y][x] = 0;\n8   \t\treturn 1 + compt(y-1, x) + compt(y+1, x)\n9   \t\t         + compt(y, x-1) + compt(y, x+1);\n10  \t}\n11  \telse return 0;\n12  }\n13  int main(int argc, char **argv)\n14  {\n15  \tunsigned long int no_cases, case_no;\n16  \tscanf(\"%lu\", &no_cases);\n17  \tfor (case_no = 0; case_no != no_cases; case_no++)\n18  \t{\n19  \t\tint r, c, x, y, s;\n20  \t\tint best = 0;\n21  \t\tchar grid[20][20];\n22  \t\tchar extras[6] = {};\n23  \t\tchar quads[16] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1};\n24  \t\tscanf(\"%i%i\", &r, &c);\n25  \t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n26  \t\t{\n27  \t\t\twhile (getchar() != '\\n') \n28  \t\t\t\t{;} \n29  \t\t\tint last = 2, this;\n30  \t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n31  \t\t\t{\n32  \t\t\t\tgrid[y][x] = this = getchar() == 'W';\n33  \t\t\t\textras[last << 1 | this] = 1;\n34  \t\t\t\tlast = this;\n35  \t\t\t}\n36  \t\t\ttemp[y][0] = temp[y][c+1] = 0;\n37  \t\t}\n38  \t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++) \n39  \t\t\ttemp[0][x] = temp[r+1][x] = 0;\n40  \t\tquads[10] |= extras[2];\n41  \t\tquads[5] |= extras[1];\n42  \t\tfor (y = 1; y != r; y++)\n43  \t\t\tfor (x = 1; x != r; x++)\n44  \t\t\t\tquads[grid[y-1][x-1] << 3 | grid[y-1][x] << 2 | grid[y][x-1] << 1 | grid[y][x]] = 1;\n45  \t\tfor (y = 1; y != r; y++)\n46  \t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != r; x++)\n47  \t\t\t{\n48  \t\t\t\tint j = grid[y-1][x] << 2 | grid[y][x];\n49  \t\t\t\tquads[j << 1 | j] = 1;\n50  \t\t\t}\n51  \t\tfor (int q = 0; q != 16; q++)\n52  \t\t\tif (quads[q])\n53  \t\t\t\tfor (int ydiv = 0; ydiv <= r; ydiv++)\n54  \t\t\t\t\tfor (int xdiv = 0; xdiv <= c; xdiv++)\n55  \t\t\t\t\t{\n56  \t\t\t\t\t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n57  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n58  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n59  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttemp[y+1][x+1] = grid[y][x] == (q >> ((y < ydiv) << 1 | (x < xdiv)) & 1);\n60  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n61  \t\t\t\t\t\tfor (y = 0; y != r; y++)\n62  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (x = 0; x != c; x++)\n63  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n64  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ts = compt(y + 1, x + 1);\n65  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (s > best) \n66  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbest = s;\n67  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n68  \t\t\t\t\t}\n69  \t\tprintf(\"Case #%lu: %i\\n\", case_no + 1, best);\n70  \t}\n71  \treturn 0;\n72  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(x,30)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<string.h>\n3   void solve(int T)\n4   {\n5     int MC[26] = {10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10};\n6     int O[26]= {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};\n7     char out[10];\n8     int U;\n9     scanf(\"%d\", &U);\n10    int i=0;\n11    char R[U], M[U];\n12    int lr, lm;\n13    while(i<10000)\n14    {\n15      scanf(\"%s %s\", M, R); \n16      lr=strlen(R);\n17      lm=strlen(M);\n18      O[R[lr-1]-'A'] = 1;\n19      if(lr==lm)\n20      {\n21        O[R[0]-'A'] = 1;\n22        if(MC[R[0]-'A'] > M[0]-'0')\n23        {\n24          MC[R[0]-'A']= M[0]-'0';\n25        } \n26      }\n27      i++;\n28    }\n29    for(i=0; i<26; i++)\n30    {\n31      if(O[i])\n32        out[MC[i]%10]='A'+i;\n33    }\n34    printf(\"Case #%d: %s\\n\",T,out);\n35    return;\n36  }\n37  int main()\n38  {\n39  \tint T,_T;\n40  \tscanf(\"%d\", &T);\n41  \t_T=T;\n42  \twhile(T--)\n43  \t{\n44  \t\tsolve(_T-T);\n45  \t}\n46  \treturn 0;\n47  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(MC,24)` in function `solve`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   typedef struct st\n4   {\n5       int x;\n6       int y;\n7   }arr;\n8   arr array[100005];\n9   int comp(const void *a, const void *b)\n10  {\n11      long long int c1 = (*(arr*)a).x;\n12      c1 *= (*(arr*)b).y;\n13      long long int c2 = (*(arr*)b).x;\n14      c2 *= (*(arr*)a).y;\n15      if (c1 == c2) return 0;\n16      else if (c1 > c2) return 1;\n17      else return -1;\n18  }\n19  int abs(int n)\n20  {\n21      if (n < 0)\n22      {\n23          return -1 * n;\n24      }\n25      return n;\n26  }\n27  int main()\n28  {\n29      int input[310][2];\n30      int cases, N;\n31      scanf(\"%d\", &cases);\n32      for (int cas = 1; cas <= cases; cas++)\n33      {\n34          scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n35          for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)\n36          {\n37              scanf(\"%d %d\", &input[i][0], &input[i][1]);\n38          }\n39          int pair = 0;\n40          for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)\n41          {\n42              for (int j = i + 1; j <= N; j++)\n43              {\n44                  long long int tmp = input[i][0] - input[j][0];\n45                  tmp *= input[i][1] - input[j][1];\n46                  if (tmp < 0)\n47                  {\n48                      array[pair].x = abs(input[i][0] - input[j][0]);\n49                      array[pair].y = abs(input[i][1] - input[j][1]);\n50                      pair++;\n51                  }\n52              }\n53          }\n54          if (pair == 0)\n55          {\n56              printf(\"Case #%d: 1\\n\", cas);\n57          }\n58          else\n59          {\n60              qsort(array, pair, sizeof(arr), comp);\n61              int ans = 2;\n62              for (int i = 1; i < pair; i++)\n63              {\n64                  long long int c1 = array[i - 1].x * array[i].y;\n65                  long long int c2 = array[i - 1].y * array[i].x;\n66                  if (c1 != c2)\n67                  {\n68                      ans++;\n69                  }\n70              }\n71              printf(\"Case #%d: %d\\n\", cas, ans);\n72          }\n73      }\n74      return 0;\n75  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(j,42)` in function `main`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #ifndef _GNU_SOURCE\n2   #define _GNU_SOURCE\n3   #endif\n4   #include <stdio.h>\n5   #include <stdlib.h>\n6   #include <string.h>\n7   #include <limits.h>\n8   #include <ctype.h>\n9   #include <stdarg.h>\n10  #include <math.h>\n11  static int dpr (const char *fmt, ...)\n12  {\n13    int res = 0;\n14    va_list ap;\n15    va_start (ap, fmt);\n16  #if 0\n17    res = vprintf (fmt, ap);\n18  #endif\n19    va_end (ap);\n20    return res;\n21  }\n22  int main ()\n23  {\n24    int T;\n25    scanf (\"%d\\n\", &T);\n26    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++)\n27      {\n28        int N, P;\n29        scanf (\"%d %d\\n\", &N, &P);\n30        int P_orig = P;\n31        int *w = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n32        int *h = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n33        int *min_add = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n34        double *max_add = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n35        double *best_min = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n36        double *best_max = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n37        double total = 0;\n38        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)\n39          {\n40            scanf (\"%d %d\\n\", w + j, h + j);\n41            int circ = (w[j] + h[j]) * 2;\n42            P -= circ;\n43            total += circ;\n44            min_add[j] = 2 * (w[j] < h[j] ? w[j] : h[j]);\n45            max_add[j] = 2 * sqrt (w[j] * w[j] + h[j] * h[j]);\n46          }\n47        dpr (\"looking for %d\\n\", P);\n48        double best_valid = 0;\n49        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)\n50          {\n51            int min1 = 0;\n52            int max1 = 0;\n53            int k1 = -1;\n54            for (int k = 0; k < j; k++)\n55              if (best_min[k] + min_add[j] < P && best_max[k] > max1) {\n56                k1 = k;\n57                min1 = best_min[k];\n58                max1 = best_max[k];\n59              }\n60            best_min[j] = min1 + min_add[j];\n61            best_max[j] = max1 + max_add[j];\n62            dpr (\"cookie %d: using prev %d [%f..%f]\\n\", j, k1, best_min[j], best_max[j]);\n63            if (best_min[j] <= P && best_max[j] > best_valid)\n64              best_valid = best_max[j];\n65          }\n66        if (best_valid > P)\n67  \t      best_valid = P;\n68        printf (\"Case #%d: %.6f\\n\", i + 1, total + best_valid);\n69        free (max_add);\n70        free (min_add);\n71        free (h);\n72        free (w);\n73      }\n74    exit (0);\n75  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(max1,58)` in function `main`?

In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #ifndef _GNU_SOURCE\n2   #define _GNU_SOURCE\n3   #endif\n4   #include <stdio.h>\n5   #include <stdlib.h>\n6   #include <string.h>\n7   #include <limits.h>\n8   #include <ctype.h>\n9   #include <stdarg.h>\n10  #include <math.h>\n11  static int dpr (const char *fmt, ...)\n12  {\n13    int res = 0;\n14    va_list ap;\n15    va_start (ap, fmt);\n16  #if 0\n17    res = vprintf (fmt, ap);\n18  #endif\n19    va_end (ap);\n20    return res;\n21  }\n22  int main ()\n23  {\n24    int T;\n25    scanf (\"%d\\n\", &T);\n26    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++)\n27      {\n28        int N, P;\n29        scanf (\"%d %d\\n\", &N, &P);\n30        int P_orig = P;\n31        int *w = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n32        int *h = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n33        int *min_add = (int *)malloc (sizeof (int) * N);\n34        double *max_add = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n35        double *best_min = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n36        double *best_max = (double *)malloc (sizeof (double) * N);\n37        double total = 0;\n38        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)\n39          {\n40            scanf (\"%d %d\\n\", w + j, h + j);\n41            int circ = (w[j] + h[j]) * 2;\n42            P -= circ;\n43            total += circ;\n44            min_add[j] = 2 * (w[j] < h[j] ? w[j] : h[j]);\n45            max_add[j] = 2 * sqrt (w[j] * w[j] + h[j] * h[j]);\n46          }\n47        dpr (\"looking for %d\\n\", P);\n48        double best_valid = 0;\n49        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)\n50          {\n51            int min1 = 0;\n52            int max1 = 0;\n53            int k1 = -1;\n54            for (int k = 0; k < j; k++)\n55              if (best_min[k] + min_add[j] < P && best_max[k] > max1) {\n56                k1 = k;\n57                min1 = best_min[k];\n58                max1 = best_max[k];\n59              }\n60            best_min[j] = min1 + min_add[j];\n61            best_max[j] = max1 + max_add[j];\n62            dpr (\"cookie %d: using prev %d [%f..%f]\\n\", j, k1, best_min[j], best_max[j]);\n63            if (best_min[j] <= P && best_max[j] > best_valid)\n64              best_valid = best_max[j];\n65          }\n66        if (best_valid > P)\n67  \t      best_valid = P;\n68        printf (\"Case #%d: %.6f\\n\", i + 1, total + best_valid);\n69        free (max_add);\n70        free (min_add);\n71        free (h);\n72        free (w);\n73      }\n74    exit (0);\n75  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(best_max,61)` in function `main`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #include<stdbool.h>\n4   #include<ctype.h>\n5   int sol[151];\n6   int queryList[150];\n7   char solStr[151];\n8   int generateQueries(int n)\n9   {\n10      int beginning = 1, end = n, i = 0;\n11      while(beginning <= end)\n12      {\n13          queryList[i] = beginning;\n14          beginning++;\n15          i++;\n16          if(beginning < end)\n17          {\n18              queryList[i] = end;\n19              end--;\n20              i++;\n21          }\n22      }\n23      while(i < 150)\n24      {\n25          queryList[i] = -1;\n26          i++;\n27      }\n28  }\n29  int findFlipBit(int n)\n30  {\n31      int i = 1;\n32      while(i <= n && sol[i] != 2)\n33      {\n34          if(sol[i] == sol[n-i+1])\n35          {\n36              return i;\n37          }\n38          else i++;\n39      }\n40      return -1;\n41  }\n42  int findSwapBit(int n)\n43  {\n44      int i = 1;\n45      while(i <= n && sol[i] != 2 && sol[n-i+1] != 2)\n46      {\n47          if(sol[i] != sol[n-i+1])\n48          {\n49              return i;\n50          }\n51          else i++;\n52      }\n53      return -1;\n54  }\n55  int query(int i)\n56  {\n57      int ret;\n58      printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n59      fflush(stdout);\n60      scanf(\"%d\", &ret);\n61      if(ret == 'N')\n62      {\n63          exit(1);\n64      }\n65      else\n66      {\n67          return ret;\n68      }\n69  }\n70  void flipSol(int n)\n71  {\n72      for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n73      {\n74          if(sol[i] == 1) sol[i] = 0;\n75          else if(sol[i] == 0) sol[i] = 1;\n76      }\n77  }\n78  void swapSol(int n)\n79  {\n80      int beginning = 1, end = n;\n81      while (beginning < end)\n82      {\n83          int aux = sol[beginning];\n84          sol[beginning] = sol[end];\n85          sol[end] = aux;\n86          beginning++;\n87          end--;\n88      }\n89  }\n90  void resolve(int n)\n91  {\n92      for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n93      {\n94          sol[i] = 2;\n95      }\n96      generateQueries(n);\n97      int queries = 0;\n98      int known = 0;\n99      int flipBit = -1, swapBit = -1;\n100      int flipRes, swapRes, doubleRes;\n101      bool flipped = false, swapped = false;\n102      while(true)\n103      {\n104          if(queries % 10 == 0 && queries != 0)\n105          {\n106              if(flipBit == -1) flipBit = findFlipBit(n);\n107              if(flipBit != -1)\n108              {\n109                  flipRes = query(flipBit);\n110                  if(flipRes != sol[flipBit]) flipSol(n);\n111                  else flipped = false;\n112                  queries++;\n113              }\n114              else\n115              {\n116                  query(1);\n117                  queries++;\n118              }\n119              if(swapBit == -1)\n120              {\n121                  swapBit = findSwapBit(n);\n122              }\n123              if(swapBit != -1)\n124              {\n125                  swapRes = query(swapBit);\n126                  if(swapRes != sol[swapBit]) swapSol(n);\n127                  else swapped = false;\n128                  queries++;\n129              }\n130              else\n131              {\n132                  query(1);\n133                  queries++;\n134              }\n135          }\n136          else\n137          {\n138              sol[queryList[known]] = query(queryList[known]);\n139              known++;\n140              queries++;\n141              if(queryList[known] == -1)\n142              {\n143                  for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)\n144                  {\n145                      printf(\"%d\", sol[i]);\n146                  }\n147                  printf(\"%d\\n\", sol[n]);\n148                  fflush(stdout);\n149                  char answer  = 10;\n150                  while (answer == 10)\n151                  {\n152                      answer = getchar();\n153                  }\n154                  if(answer == 'Y')\n155                  {\n156                      return;\n157                  }\n158                  else\n159                  {\n160                      exit(7);\n161                  }\n162              }\n163          }\n164      }\n165  }\n166  int main(void)\n167  {\n168      int t, n;\n169      scanf(\"%d %d\", &t, &n);\n170      for(int test = 0; test < t; test++)\n171      {\n172          resolve(n);\n173      }\n174      return 0;\n175  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(queryList,25)` in function `generateQueries`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   #include<stdlib.h>\n3   #include<stdbool.h>\n4   #include<ctype.h>\n5   int sol[151];\n6   int queryList[150];\n7   char solStr[151];\n8   int generateQueries(int n)\n9   {\n10      int beginning = 1, end = n, i = 0;\n11      while(beginning <= end)\n12      {\n13          queryList[i] = beginning;\n14          beginning++;\n15          i++;\n16          if(beginning < end)\n17          {\n18              queryList[i] = end;\n19              end--;\n20              i++;\n21          }\n22      }\n23      while(i < 150)\n24      {\n25          queryList[i] = -1;\n26          i++;\n27      }\n28  }\n29  int findFlipBit(int n)\n30  {\n31      int i = 1;\n32      while(i <= n && sol[i] != 2)\n33      {\n34          if(sol[i] == sol[n-i+1])\n35          {\n36              return i;\n37          }\n38          else i++;\n39      }\n40      return -1;\n41  }\n42  int findSwapBit(int n)\n43  {\n44      int i = 1;\n45      while(i <= n && sol[i] != 2 && sol[n-i+1] != 2)\n46      {\n47          if(sol[i] != sol[n-i+1])\n48          {\n49              return i;\n50          }\n51          else i++;\n52      }\n53      return -1;\n54  }\n55  int query(int i)\n56  {\n57      int ret;\n58      printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n59      fflush(stdout);\n60      scanf(\"%d\", &ret);\n61      if(ret == 'N')\n62      {\n63          exit(1);\n64      }\n65      else\n66      {\n67          return ret;\n68      }\n69  }\n70  void flipSol(int n)\n71  {\n72      for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n73      {\n74          if(sol[i] == 1) sol[i] = 0;\n75          else if(sol[i] == 0) sol[i] = 1;\n76      }\n77  }\n78  void swapSol(int n)\n79  {\n80      int beginning = 1, end = n;\n81      while (beginning < end)\n82      {\n83          int aux = sol[beginning];\n84          sol[beginning] = sol[end];\n85          sol[end] = aux;\n86          beginning++;\n87          end--;\n88      }\n89  }\n90  void resolve(int n)\n91  {\n92      for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n93      {\n94          sol[i] = 2;\n95      }\n96      generateQueries(n);\n97      int queries = 0;\n98      int known = 0;\n99      int flipBit = -1, swapBit = -1;\n100      int flipRes, swapRes, doubleRes;\n101      bool flipped = false, swapped = false;\n102      while(true)\n103      {\n104          if(queries % 10 == 0 && queries != 0)\n105          {\n106              if(flipBit == -1) flipBit = findFlipBit(n);\n107              if(flipBit != -1)\n108              {\n109                  flipRes = query(flipBit);\n110                  if(flipRes != sol[flipBit]) flipSol(n);\n111                  else flipped = false;\n112                  queries++;\n113              }\n114              else\n115              {\n116                  query(1);\n117                  queries++;\n118              }\n119              if(swapBit == -1)\n120              {\n121                  swapBit = findSwapBit(n);\n122              }\n123              if(swapBit != -1)\n124              {\n125                  swapRes = query(swapBit);\n126                  if(swapRes != sol[swapBit]) swapSol(n);\n127                  else swapped = false;\n128                  queries++;\n129              }\n130              else\n131              {\n132                  query(1);\n133                  queries++;\n134              }\n135          }\n136          else\n137          {\n138              sol[queryList[known]] = query(queryList[known]);\n139              known++;\n140              queries++;\n141              if(queryList[known] == -1)\n142              {\n143                  for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)\n144                  {\n145                      printf(\"%d\", sol[i]);\n146                  }\n147                  printf(\"%d\\n\", sol[n]);\n148                  fflush(stdout);\n149                  char answer  = 10;\n150                  while (answer == 10)\n151                  {\n152                      answer = getchar();\n153                  }\n154                  if(answer == 'Y')\n155                  {\n156                      return;\n157                  }\n158                  else\n159                  {\n160                      exit(7);\n161                  }\n162              }\n163          }\n164      }\n165  }\n166  int main(void)\n167  {\n168      int t, n;\n169      scanf(\"%d %d\", &t, &n);\n170      for(int test = 0; test < t; test++)\n171      {\n172          resolve(n);\n173      }\n174      return 0;\n175  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(end,19)` in function `generateQueries`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include<stdio.h>\n2   void alienpylon(int, int, int);\n3   int main()\n4   {\n5       int n,i;\n6       int r,c;\n7       scanf(\"%d\",&n);\n8       for(i=0;i<n;i++)\n9       {\n10          scanf(\"%d %d\",&r,&c);\n11          alienpylon(r,c,i);\n12      }\n13      return 0;\n14  }\n15  void alienpylon(int a,int b,int i)\n16  {\n17      int k,temp1=a,temp2=b;\n18      if(b>=a)\n19      {\n20          if(b-a==1||a+1==b||a-1==b||b+1==a||b-1==a||a==b)\n21          {\n22              printf(\"Case #%d: IMPOSSIBLE\\n\",i+1);\n23          }\n24          else\n25          {\n26              printf(\"Case #%d: POSSIBLE\\n\",i+1);\n27              for(k=1;k<=a*b;k++)\n28              {\n29                  temp1+=(((b/a)-1)%a);\n30                  temp1=temp1%a;\n31                  temp2+=(((b%a)+1)%b);\n32                  temp2=temp2%b;\n33                  printf(\"%d %d\\n\",temp1+1,temp2+1);\n34              }\n35          }\n36      }else{\n37          if(a-b==1||a+1==b||a-1==b||b+1==a||b-1==a||a==b)\n38          {\n39              printf(\"Case #%d: IMPOSSIBLE\\n\",i+1);\n40          }\n41          else\n42          {\n43              printf(\"Case #%d: POSSIBLE\\n\",i+1);\n44              for(k=1;k<=a*b;k++)\n45              {\n46                  temp2+=(((a/b)-1)%b);\n47                  temp2=temp2%b;\n48                  temp1+=(((a%b)+1)%a);\n49                  temp1=temp1%a;\n50                  printf(\"%d %d\\n\",temp2+1,temp1+1);\n51              }\n52          }\n53      }\n54  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(k,44)` in function `alienpylon`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`.

That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`?

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <math.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   #include <stdlib.h>\n5   typedef struct\n6   {\n7   \tint x;\n8   \tint y;\n9   } par;\n10  double get_double();\n11  int get_int();\n12  int max(int, int);\n13  int min(int, int);\n14  int main()\n15  {\n16  \tint i, j, k;\n17  \tint t = get_int();\n18  \tfor (i = 0; i < t; i++)\n19  \t{\n20  \t\tint n = get_int();\n21  \t\tint w[n];\n22  \t\tint c[n][n];\n23  \t\tmemset(c, 0, sizeof(c));\n24  \t\tfor (j = 0; j < n; j++)\n25  \t\t{\n26  \t\t\tw[j] = get_int();\n27  \t\t}\n28  \t\tc[0][0] = w[0];\n29  \t\tfor (j = 1; j < n; j++)\n30  \t\t{\n31  \t\t\tc[0][j] = min(w[j], c[0][j - 1]);\n32  \t\t}\n33  \t\tfor (j = 1; j < n; j++)\n34  \t\t{\n35  \t\t\tif (c[j - 1][j - 1] == -1)\n36  \t\t\t{\n37  \t\t\t\tc[j][j] = -1;\n38  \t\t\t}\n39  \t\t\telse\n40  \t\t\t{\n41  \t\t\t\tif (c[j - 1][j - 1] > w[j]*6)\n42  \t\t\t\t{\n43  \t\t\t\t\tc[j][j] = -1;\n44  \t\t\t\t}\n45  \t\t\t\telse\n46  \t\t\t\t{\n47  \t\t\t\t\tc[j][j] = c[j - 1][j - 1] + w[j];\n48  \t\t\t\t}\n49  \t\t\t}\n50  \t\t}\n51  \t\tfor (j = 1; j < n; j++)\n52  \t\t{\n53  \t\t\tfor (k = j + 1; k < n; k++)\n54  \t\t\t{\n55  \t\t\t\tif (c[j - 1][k - 1] == -1 && c[j][k - 1] == -1)\n56  \t\t\t\t{\n57  \t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] = -1;\n58  \t\t\t\t}\n59  \t\t\t\telse if (c[j - 1][k - 1] == -1)\n60  \t\t\t\t{\n61  \t\t\t\t\tif (c[j][k - 1] > w[k]*6)\n62  \t\t\t\t\t{\n63  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] == -1;\n64  \t\t\t\t\t}\n65  \t\t\t\t\telse\n66  \t\t\t\t\t{\n67  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] = c[j][k - 1] + w[k];\n68  \t\t\t\t\t}\n69  \t\t\t\t}\n70  \t\t\t\telse if(c[j][k - 1] == -1)\n71  \t\t\t\t{\n72  \t\t\t\t\tif (c[j - 1][k - 1] > w[k]*6)\n73  \t\t\t\t\t{\n74  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] == -1;\n75  \t\t\t\t\t}\n76  \t\t\t\t\telse\n77  \t\t\t\t\t{\n78  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] = c[j - 1][k - 1] + w[k];\n79  \t\t\t\t\t}\n80  \t\t\t\t}\n81  \t\t\t\telse\n82  \t\t\t\t{\n83  \t\t\t\t\tint tmp = min(c[j - 1][k - 1], c[j][k - 1]);\n84  \t\t\t\t\tif (tmp > w[k]*6)\n85  \t\t\t\t\t{\n86  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] = -1;\n87  \t\t\t\t\t}\n88  \t\t\t\t\telse\n89  \t\t\t\t\t{\n90  \t\t\t\t\t\tc[j][k] = tmp + w[k];\n91  \t\t\t\t\t}\n92  \t\t\t\t}\n93  \t\t\t}\n94  \t\t}\n95  \t\tfor (j = 0; j < n; j++)\n96  \t\t{\n97  \t\t\tif (c[j][n - 1] == -1)\n98  \t\t\t{\n99  \t\t\t\tbreak;\n100  \t\t\t}\n101  \t\t}\n102  \t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: %d\\n\", i + 1, j);\n103  \t}\n104  }\n105  int max(int a, int b)\n106  {\n107  \tif (a > b)\n108  \t{\n109  \t\treturn a;\n110  \t}\n111  \treturn b;\n112  }\n113  int min(int a, int b)\n114  {\n115  \tif (a < b)\n116  \t{\n117  \t\treturn a;\n118  \t}\n119  \treturn b;\n120  }\n121  double get_double()\n122  {\n123  \tdouble ret = 0;\n124  \tchar c     = getchar();\n125  \tint sgn;\n126  \twhile (1)\n127  \t{\n128  \t\tif (c == EOF)\n129  \t\t{\n130  \t\t\treturn EOF;\n131  \t\t}\n132  \t\tif (c >= '0' && c <= '9')\n133  \t\t{\n134  \t\t\tsgn = 1;\n135  \t\t\tbreak;\n136  \t\t}\n137  \t\tif (c == '-')\n138  \t\t{\n139  \t\t\tc = getchar();\n140  \t\t\tif (c < '0' || c > '9')\n141  \t\t\t{\n142  \t\t\t\tcontinue;\n143  \t\t\t}\n144  \t\t\tsgn = -1;\n145  \t\t\tbreak;\n146  \t\t}\n147  \t\tc = getchar();\n148  \t}\n149  \twhile (1)\n150  \t{\n151  \t\tret = ret*10 + c - '0';\n152  \t\tc = getchar();\n153  \t\tif (c == '.')\n154  \t\t{\n155  \t\t\tdouble pos = 0.1;\n156  \t\t\tc = getchar();\n157  \t\t\twhile (c >= '0' && c <= '9')\n158  \t\t\t{\n159  \t\t\t\tret += pos*(c - '0');\n160  \t\t\t\tpos /= 10;\n161  \t\t\t\tc = getchar();\n162  \t\t\t}\n163  \t\t\treturn sgn*ret;\n164  \t\t}\n165  \t\telse if (c < '0' || c > '9')\n166  \t\t{\n167  \t\t\treturn sgn*ret;\n168  \t\t}\n169  \t}\n170  }\n171  int get_int()\n172  {\n173  \tint ret = 0;\n174  \tchar c  = getchar();\n175  \tint sgn;\n176  \twhile (1)\n177  \t{\n178  \t\tif (c == EOF)\n179  \t\t{\n180  \t\t\treturn EOF;\n181  \t\t}\n182  \t\tif (c >= '0' && c <= '9')\n183  \t\t{\n184  \t\t\tsgn = 1;\n185  \t\t\tbreak;\n186  \t\t}\n187  \t\tif (c == '-')\n188  \t\t{\n189  \t\t\tc = getchar();\n190  \t\t\tif (c < '0' || c > '9')\n191  \t\t\t{\n192  \t\t\t\tcontinue;\n193  \t\t\t}\n194  \t\t\tsgn = -1;\n195  \t\t\tbreak;\n196  \t\t}\n197  \t\tc = getchar();\n198  \t}\n199  \twhile (1)\n200  \t{\n201  \t\tret = (ret << 3) + (ret << 1) + c - '0';\n202  \t\tc = getchar();\n203  \t\tif (c < '0' || c > '9')\n204  \t\t{\n205  \t\t\treturn sgn*ret;\n206  \t\t}\n207  \t}\n208  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(ret,159)` in function `get_double`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**.

Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7.

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <stdlib.h>\n3   #include <string.h>\n4   int minswaps(char* p, int d, int len);\n5   int main()\n6   {\n7   \tint n,i;\n8   \tscanf(\"%d\",&n);\n9   \tfor(i=0;i<n;i++)\n10  \t{\n11  \t\tint d;\n12  \t\tchar p[31];\n13  \t\tscanf(\"%d \",&d);\n14  \t\tscanf(\"%s\",p);\n15  \t\tint r=minswaps(p,d,strlen(p));\n16  \t\tif(r==-1)\n17  \t\t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: IMPOSSIBLE\\n\",i+1 );\n18  \t\telse\n19  \t\t\tprintf(\"Case #%d: %d\\n\",i+1,r );\n20  \t}\n21  }\n22  int minswaps(char* p, int d, int len)\n23  {\n24      if(len==2)\n25      {\n26          if(p[0]=='S' && p[1]=='C')\n27              return(0);\n28          if(p[0]=='S'&&p[1]=='S')\n29          {\n30              if(d<2)\n31                  return(-1);\n32              else\n33                  return(0);\n34          }\n35          if(p[0]=='C' && p[1]=='S')\n36          {\n37              if(d<2)\n38                  return(1);\n39              else\n40                  return(0);\n41          }\n42          return(0);\n43      }\n44      int i,strength=1,damage=0,temp,k=0,swaps=0,flag=0;\n45      int * a=(int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*len);\n46      for(i=0;i<len;i++)\n47      {\n48          if(p[i]=='S')\n49          {\n50              damage+=strength;\n51              a[k++]=strength;\n52          }\n53          else\n54          {\n55              strength*=2;\n56              a[k++]=strength;\n57          }\n58      }\n59      if(damage<=d)\n60          return(0);\n61      i=len-1;\n62      while(!flag)\n63      {\n64            flag=1;\n65            i=len-1;\n66            while(damage-d>0 && i>0)\n67            {\n68                while(p[i]!='S')\n69                    i--;\n70                if(p[i-1]=='S')\n71                    i--;\n72                else\n73                {\n74                    flag=0;\n75                    p[i]='C';\n76                    p[i-1]='S';\n77                    damage-=a[i];\n78                    if(i-1==0)\n79                    {\n80                        a[i-1]=1;\n81                        a[i]=2;\n82                    }\n83                    else\n84                    {\n85                      a[i-1]=a[i-2];\n86                      a[i]=2*a[i-1];\n87                    }\n88                    damage+=a[i-1];\n89                    swaps++;\n90                }\n91                if(i==1 && p[i-1]=='S')\n92                {\n93                  break;\n94                }\n95            }\n96      }\n97      free(a);\n98      if(damage-d<=0)\n99          return(swaps);\n100      else\n101          return(-1);\n102  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(damage,88)` in function `minswaps`?

All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10.

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`?

Please perform a **static** analysis of \u201cinformation flow\u201d on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n\n## 1. Information Flow Definition\n\nAn **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n\nWe denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n\n\n### Types of Direct Flows\n\n- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n\n\n  **Example 1**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n\n\n  **Example 2**:\n    ```\n    1  x = 5\n    2  if cond:\n    3      y = x + 1\n    ```\n    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n\n    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n    \n\n\n- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n\n  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`\u2019s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n\n  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n\n  **Example**:\n  ```\n  1  z = x + 5\n  2  if z > 1:\n  3      y = 10\n  ```\n  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n  \n  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n\n\n\n### Information Flow Between Variables\n\nAn **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** \u2014 explicit, implicit, or both \u2014 connecting them.\n\nThat is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n`(varA, lineA) -> ... -> (varB, lineB)`\n\n\n\n## 2. **Output Format**  \n\nWhen asked \"Which variable instances have information flow over `(targetVar, targetLine)`? List all such variables.\", respond:, respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"valA\", lineA],\n      [\"valB\", lineB],\n      ...\n    ]\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you believe there is no variables have information flow on `(targetVar, targetLine)`, respond:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": false\n}\n```\n\n\n## 3. **Intraprocedural Data Dependence**  \n   All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. **Example Code Snippet**:\n\n\n### Example 1\n```python\n1  def example_func():\n2      status = 0\n3      flag = False\n4      balance = 1000\n5      balance += 500\n6      if balance > 1000:\n7          status = 1\n8          flag = True\n9      limit = status * 5000\n10     transaction = limit * 0.2\n11     return flag\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(transaction,10)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 10: `(transaction,10)` reads `limit`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(limit,9)` to `(transaction,10)`. \n- Line 9: `(limit,9)` reads `status`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(status,7)` (or `(status,2)`) to `(limit,9)`. \n- Line 7: `(status,7)` is updated only if line 6\u2019s condition is true, so has a direct control dependence on line 6.\n- Line 6: checks `balance > 1000`, reads from `(balance,5)`, so there is a direct implicit flow from `(balance,5)` to `(status,7)` through `balance` at line 6.\n- Line 5: `(balance,5)` reads from `(balance,4)`, so there is a direct explicit flow from `(balance,4)` to `(balance,5)`.\n- Line 4: `(balance,4)` initializes the variable balance.\n  \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"limit\", 9],\n      [\"status\", 2],\n      [\"status\", 7],\n      [\"balance\", 4],\n      [\"balance\", 5],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n \n#### Example Question 1.2\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(flag,3)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**\nLine 3 initializes `flag` without any data dependency or control dependency. \n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"InfomationFlowSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Example 2\n```python\n1.  val = 5\n2.  size = 3\n3.  arr = [0] * size\n4.  i = 0\n5.  j = 1\n6.  total = 0\n7.  if val > 2:\n8.      arr[j % size] = j\n9.  while i < size:\n10.     arr[j] += 1\n11.     score = arr[j+1]\n12.     total += score * 2\n13.     diff = total - score\n14.     j = (j + 1) % size\n15.     i += 1\n16. last = arr[-1]\n17. summary = diff + j\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(summary,17)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 17: `(summary,17)` reads `diff` and `j`. `diff` is from line 13. Next, we focus on the path through `j`. `j` is updated from line 14 and line 5. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. When line 9 never evaluates to `true`, `(summary,17)` reads `j` from `(j,5)`. When line 9 evaluates to `true`, line 14 will be executed. \n- Line 14: `(j,14)` is updated inside the `while i < size` loop, so its update is control-dependent on the loop condition at line 9. There is also an explicit flow from `size` to `j`.\n- Line 9: `while i < size` reads `size` (a pure read), so has a direct explicit flow from `(size,2)`. It also reads `i` from line 15 or line 4.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"diff\", 13],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.2:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(score,11)`? List all such variables.\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 11: `(score,11)` reads `arr[j+1]`. There is a direct data dependence on both `arr` and `j`. That `j` may come from either `(j,5)` (initial) or subsequent updates at `(j,14)`. `arr` may come from line 3, line 8, or line 10 given the index `j+1` is with an unknown value. \n- Static analysis assumption: Every branch or loop condition may succeed or fail; we do not prune unreachable paths. Therefore, `j` could be read from either line 5 (e.g., when it is the first iteration of the while loop) or line 14 (e.g., when it is the not the first iteration of the while loop). Similar for `arr`, it could be read from line 3, line 8, or line 10.\n- If `arr` is read from line 10, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n- If `arr` is read from line 8, there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also implicit flow from `val` (as in the condition in line 7) read from line 1.\n- If `arr` is read from line 3, there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- Line 11 is control-dependent on line 9, therefore there is a implicit flow from `i` (possibly from `(i,15)` or `(i,4)`) and `size` (possibly from `(size,2)`) to line 11.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4:\nWhich variable instances have information flow over `(last,16)`? List all such variables.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 16: `(last,16)` reads `arr[-1]`. That element may have been modified by the assignment in line 8, by the loop updates in line 10, or by initialization at line 3. Under static analysis, multiple update sites may contribute. \n- If from Line 3: there is an explicit flow from `(size,2)` to it.\n- If from line 8: `arr[j % size] = j` executes only if `val > 2`, so `(arr,8)` has a direct control dependence on `(val,1)` via the `if` at line 7. There is also an explicit flow from `(j,5)` and `(size,2)` to `arr`.\n- If from line 10:  there is an explicit flow from `(j,5)`, `(j,14)`, and `(size,2)` to `arr`. There is also an explicit flow from `arr` itself because the operation is `+=`, hence from `(arr,3)`, `(arr,8)`, or `(arr,10)`. There is also an implicit flow from `i` and `size` to line 10. Hence from `(i, 4)`, `(i,15)`, and `(size,2)`.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n   {\n    \"InfomationFlowSources\": [\n      [\"arr\", 10],\n      [\"arr\", 8],\n      [\"arr\", 3],\n      [\"j\", 14],\n      [\"j\", 5],\n      [\"size\", 2],\n      [\"i\", 4],\n      [\"i\", 15],\n      [\"val\", 1]\n    ]\n   }\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>          \n2   #include <stdbool.h>\n3   const char NUL = '\\0';\n4   bool\n5   ope_line()\n6   {\n7   \tchar oline[101];\n8   \tconst char letter[6][5] = {\"abcde\", \"fghij\", \"klmno\", \"pqrst\", \"uvwxy\", \"z.?! \"};\n9   \tint c = getc(stdin);\n10  \tif (c == EOF)\n11  \t\treturn false;\n12  \tif (c == '\\n')\n13  \t\treturn true;\n14  \tbool b_na = false;\n15  \tint ix = 0;\n16  \twhile (c != '\\n' && c != EOF)\n17  \t{\n18  \t\tint s = c - '1';\n19  \t\tc = getc(stdin);\n20  \t\tif (c == '\\n' || c == EOF)\n21  \t\t{\n22  \t\t\tb_na = true;\n23  \t\t\tbreak;\n24  \t\t}\n25  \t\tint t = c - '1';\n26  \t\toline[ix++] = letter[s][t];\n27  \t\tc = getc(stdin);\n28  \t}\n29  \tif (b_na)\n30  \t\tprintf(\"NA\\n\");\n31  \telse\n32  \t{\n33  \t\toline[ix] = NUL;\n34  \t\tprintf(\"%s\\n\", oline);\n35  \t}\n36  \tif (c == EOF)\n37  \t\treturn false;\n38  \treturn true;\n39  }\n40  int\n41  main(int argc, char **argv)\n42  {\n43  \twhile (true)\n44  \t{\n45  \t\tif (!ope_line())\n46  \t\t\tbreak;\n47  \t}\n48  \treturn 0;\n49  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which variable instances have information flow over `(t,25)` in function `ope_line`?
